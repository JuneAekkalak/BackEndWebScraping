  "abstract": "Polydopamine (PDA) is a kind of mussel-inspired material. It has been applied as a coating and an adsorbent material. As an adsorbent, the PDA microspheres were used to remove methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution. It was reported that the efficiency of the PDA adsorbent depends on the pH of the solution. Furthermore, in a pH range of 3-10, the hydroxyl and amine functional groups of PDA can be either protonated or deprotonated. The change of the net charge of PDA can affect the intermolecular interactions between PDA and MB. It was proposed that both of the electrostatic and π-π interactions should be dominant in the acidic and basic solutions. Therefore, the structural properties and intermolecular interactions of the PDA-MB complex should be investigated. Such an investigation can be useful for the improvement of the PDA microspheres for the other dyes. To get insight into the roles of PDA structure and its role as an interesting adsorbent for MB, the PDA-MB complex formation was carried out at pH 7. The PDA dimers which have six possible structures were selected. The optimization of all PDA dimers and MB was performed in the gas phase at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) calculations. After that, the complex formation of the optimized PDA dimers and MB was performed using the AutoDock Vina V1.1.2. The binding free energy of the PDA dimers and MB was in a range of-3.2 to-3.7 kcal/mol, which indicated that the binding of PDA dimer and MB is spontaneous. The results showed that the π-π interaction between PDA dimer and MB plays a crucial role in the complex formation. Likewise, the sandwich-like structures of the complexes are more stable than the twisted structures. © 2020, Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Several past studies of EFL learners’ reading strategies have focused either on the strategies they used for learning to read or on those they used for taking tests. However, studies that distinguish the reading strategies used by EFL learners for learning-to-read purposes from those used for test-taking purposes in the target language, and that focus on the probable hierarchy of language learning strategies, have not been found. This study attempted to address these research gaps in the rarely studied EFL context of Thai undergraduates. One hundred and thirty-five Thai undergraduates were categorized based on reading test scores into high and low proficiency readers. Then, a questionnaire, five multiple-choice and 22 5-point Likert scale items, was administered to identify reading strategies for learning to read and for taking tests that distinguished the two groups. All significant learning-to-read and test-taking strategies were then ordered based on degrees of mean differences to determine the hierarchy. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and tests of statistical significance (p < 0.05). The results showed the top learning-to-read and test-taking strategies that significantly distinguished the high proficiency from the low proficiency readers were affective and cognitive strategies, respectively. The findings shed light on significant cultural consideration for EFL strategy-based reading instruction. © 2022 Eskisehir Osmangazi University. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "This article presents the design of a low-cost Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) for monitoring vital signs including a low-cost smart wristwatch that contains an ESP-32 microcontroller and three sensors: heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and body temperature (BT), and an Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The vital signs data are processed and displayed on an OLED screen of the patient’s wristwatch and sent the data over a wireless connection (Wi-Fi) and a Cloud Thing Board system, to store and manage the data in a data center. The data can be analyzed and notified to medical staff when abnormal signals are received from the sensors based on a set parameters from specialists. The proposed low-cost system can be used in a wide range of applications including field hospitals for asymptotic or mild-condition COVID-19 patients as the system can be used to screen those patients out of symptomatic patients who require more costly facilities in a hospital with considerably low expense and installation time, also suitable for bedridden patients, palliative care patients, etc. Testing experiments of a 60-person sample size showed an acceptable accuracy level compared with standard devices when testing with 60 patient-samples with the mean errors heart rate of 1.22%, systolic blood pressure of 1.39%, diastolic blood pressure of 1.01%, and body temperature of 0.13%. According to testing results with 10 smart devices connected with the platform, the time delay caused by the distance between smart devices and the router is 10 s each round with the longest outdoor distance of 200 m. As there is a short-time delay, it does not affect the working ability of the smart system. It is still making the proposed system be able to show patient’s status and function in emergency cases. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents a bandwidth enhancement of a dual-band bi-directional rectangular microstrip patch antenna. The novelty of this work lies in the modification of conventional rectangular microstip patch antenna by using the combination of two techniques: a complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) and a defected patch structure (DPS). The structure of antenna was studied and investigated via computer simulation technology (CST). The dimension and position of CSRR on the ground plane was optimized to achieve dual bandwidth and bi-directional radiation pattern characteristics. In addition, the bandwidths were enhanced by defecting suitable shape incorporated in the microstrip patch. A prototype with overall dimension of 70.45×63.73 mm2 has been fabricated on FR-4 substrate. To verify the proposed design, the impedance bandwidth, gain, and radiation patterns were carried out in measurements. The measured impedance bandwidths were respectively 560 MHz (3.08-3.64 GHz) and 950 GHz (4.64-5.59 GHz) while the measured gains of each bandwidth were respectively 4.28 dBi and 4.63 dBi. The measured radiation patterns were in good agreement with simulated ones. The proposed antenna achieves wide dual bandwidth and bidirectional radiation patterns performances. Consequently, it is a promising candidate for Wi-Fi or 5G communications in specific areas such as tunnel, corridor, or transit and rail. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

  "abstract": "Owing to various advantages over conventional drying systems, microwave drying technology has been widely applied to vast industrial applications. During microwave drying especially in high moisture content products such as fruits and vegetables, temperature will increase dramatically since they are very responsive to microwave absorption. The characteristics of materials may change with the uncontrolled temperature and result in thermal burning and non-uniform temperature distribution in treated materials. To ensure the effective control without the material degradation, in this paper we propose the automatic phase-controlled of magnetron driver based on temperature detection. The low cost and non-contact infrared temperature measurement is implemented and evaluated in microwave environment. The objective of this proposed control is to automatically control the power output of the magnetron according to the actual product temperature. The hardware component selections and software flowchart are described. The feedback control algorithm based on microcontroller Arduino Mega 2560 is also presented in details. Experimental results of the proposed automatic temperature control of microwave drying system are investigated and verified the effectiveness of the proposed control system. © 2016 IEEE.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents a high‐frequency pulse‐density‐modulated (PDM) soft‐switching series load resonant inverter for use in induction heating (IH) fixed roller applications, which is used in copy and printing machines. The proposed simple high‐frequency resonant inverter uses an asymmetrical pulse pattern PDM control scheme to achieve complete zero‐current soft‐switching commutations over a wide output range of input power regulation. Additionally, when the printer toner requires operation in very light load conditions, this causes difficulty in achieving zero‐volt-age or zero‐current soft‐switching operations in the IH high‐frequency resonant inverters with pulse frequency modulation or pulse width modulation control schemes. The proposed resonant inverter demonstrates the capability to accomplish highly efficient power conversions. In this work, a fixed roller for printing machines is developed for doing experiments to verify the efficiency of the proposed circuit topology and its PDM control schemes. The inverter’s steady‐state and transient operating principles are analyzed based on the proposed control strategy at a high‐frequency PDM. Operating conditions such as power loss analysis, power conversion efficiency and temperature rise characteristics of the proposed inverter are presented and analyzed through experimental results. Finally, from a practical viewpoint, a comparative study of a conventional halogen lamp heater and the proposed IH fixed roller is deliberated. © 2022 by the authors.

  "abstract": "High-frequency switching pulse modulation utility-interfaced power conditioners (HF-UPC) with a high-frequency transformer link have attracted special interest for renewable and sustainable energy utilisation. These conditioners are small and cost-effective for meeting the requirements of small-scale residential power applications. However, switching power losses due to high-frequency switching operations are unavoidable. Efforts to reduce the power losses by implementing additional snubber components can complicate the controlling methods of the system. To solve these problems, a flyback transformer linked HF-UPC is proposed. The high-frequency flyback transformer is introduced into the power conditioner system instead of the typical forward transformer to simplify the circuit configuration and related controlling methods. With the aid of the resonant snubber circuits, the high-frequency switching devices in the primary side of the proposed DC-to-AC power conditioner can be turned off with zero-voltage soft-switching (ZVS). In addition, the proposed power conditioner system takes advantage of operating the currents by the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to realise turn-on commutation of zero-current soft-switching schemes. The output ports of the HF-UPC treated here are directly connected to the utility grid single-phase AC power source. A prototype of the proposed soft-commutation HF-UPC has been built and tested in experiments. Its power conversion processing is verified and its output current is qualified in accordance with the guidelines of the power utility companies.",

With the aid of the switched-capacitor resonant snubber cell, the high-frequency switching devices in the primary side of the proposed DC-to-AC power inverter can be turned-off with zero voltage soft-switching (ZVS). Moreover, the proposed power conditioner operates the currents in the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and takes the advantages of zero current soft-switching turn-on. Its output port is connected directly to the utility grid AC power source. At the end, the prototype of the proposed HF-UPC is built and tested in the experiments.

  "abstract": "This paper presents a novel prototype of the utility-interfacing sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) inverter using the high-frequency flyback transformer for the small-scale solar photovoltaic power conditioner (1kW - 4kW). The proposed SPWM power conditioner circuit with a high-frequency link has a function of electrical isolation, which is vital for PV power conditioner systems with the viewpoint of safety, noise requirement and convenience. The discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation of the flyback transformer link pulse modulation is also introduced to establish a simple topology of the inverter circuit and control scheme. The proposed PV power conditioner operates with ZVS when it turns off the primary-side switches by the high-frequency switching. This reduces the power losses of the semi-conductor device switchings and improves the power conversion efficiency of the total system as PV power processor. The operating principle of the proposed circuit is described for the understanding of the circuit parameters establishment Then, the digital control scheme is demonstrated herein. The proposed power conditioner is verified on the basis of the computer simulations and experiments. The experimented results show the validity of the proposed power conditioner to have high power conversion efficiency and low harmonic distortions.",

As compared with the conventional full-bridge hard switching sinewave PWM inverter with a high frequency AC link, the simplest single-ended quasi-resonant soft switching sinewave modulated inverter with a sinewave duty cycle pulse control scheme is implemented, resulting in size and weight reduction, low-cost and efficiency. This paper presents a prototype circuit and system of the single-ended zero voltage soft switching sinewave PWM inverter for solar power conditioner, along with its operating principle and unique features. In addition to these, this paper proposes a control implementation to deliver high quality output current. Major design of each component and the power loss analysis under actual power conditioning and processing is also discussed and evaluated from an experimental point of view. A newly-developed utility-interactive sinewave power conditioning processor which has 92.5% efficiency at 4kW output is demonstrated herein.

  "abstract": "As clean and high energy efficient, the microwave drying system has gained popularity for a wide variety of food preservation and processing of bio-commodities. The main advantage is the acceleration of the drying process which is quite limited comparing to conventional hot air drying system. However, during microwave drying process, pressure and temperature will increase continuously and this might cause undesired side effects such as degradation and physical damages. In order to eliminate the mentioned problems and enhance higher performance of control system flexibility, in this paper, a design of multi-stage phase-controlled converter for microwave drying system is proposed. The objective of this multi-stage power control is to track the drying characteristics under microwave drying process at different power level depending on the stage of drying cycle period. This control approach is achieved by controlling the triggering events at appropriate phase angle of TRIAC based on predefined power profiles. By varying the pulse width, the average power output of the magnetron can be controlled. As the focus of this paper, the hardware design and component selections are discussed. The system flowchart and control algorithm based on microcontroller Arduino Mega 2560 are also presented in details. Experimental results of the proposed multi-stage phased-control converter are investigated and discussed. © 2016 IEEE.",

However, the process efficiency is primarily dependent on catalytic-film. The main purpose of this study is to synthesize pre-vulcanized latex impregnated with TiO2 (PVL-TiO2 thin film) from natural rubber to be used in photo-catalytic oxidation for benzene removal in a reactor. PVL-TiO2 thin films were synthesized for 3 different dosages of TiO2, which were 5%, 15%, and 25% The outcome of this study offers the new application of modified natural rubber in terms of environmental and health care protection. Morphology of the synthesized films was analyzed by SEM. The results showed that TiO2 particles could be well dispersed all over the surface of the film, in which the best distribution could be found for the PVL-TiO2 15% thin film. Tensile stress of the films was analyzed using ASTM D412. Results showed that the stress of the films got higher with the increasing amount of TiO2 content. This indicates that TiO2 strengthened the PVL-TiO2 film because the uniformly distribution of TiO2 on the inner surface increased the strength of the film. The decomposition of PVL and PVL-TiO2 thin films was analyzed using thermo gravimetric analysis. The maximum weight loss rates in the range of 1.536–1.145 wt%/°C attained at between 380 - 382 °C TiO2 particles enhanced thermal stability of PVL-TiO2 thin films due to the high decomposition temperature of its properties and also acted as barrier for the heat transfer of the films. Specific surface area (SSA) of the films was analyzed using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. Specific surface area increased as the increasing content of TiO2, which corresponded to the morphology analysis by SEM. The analysis of chemical functional group of thin films was performed using ATR-FTIR. The results of Crystal identification using XRD clearly showed good attachment of rutile TiO2 on the films. Finally, results of absorbance spectrums and band gap energy showed that PVL not only peg TiO2 particles but also reducing band gap energy which induced by S and ZnO. Therefore, PVL-TiO2 thin films could be used under visible light condition. The films were then used in the study of benzene removal in annular reactor. The highest removal efficiency (83%)for the PVL-TiO2 15% thin film was obtained. Comparing to the maximum removal efficiency for PVL film (28%), roughly 60% increase in efficiency was achieved. The PCO kinetics were well fit by a first order Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The calculation of oxidation rate and percentage of residual intermediates indicated that accumulation of residual intermediates can occur on the active site and the gas phase, resulting in increasing of residual intermediates. The successful synthesis of PVL-TiO2 thin film provides new opportunity to use natural rubber in terms of environmental and health care protection. © 2020 The Author(s)",

  "abstract": "Among available technologies to remove heavy metals from wastewater, biosorption has gained more attention due to its high removal efficiency, friendly operation, and inexpensive cost. Despite many studies on metal adsorption from single ion solutions, kinetics and isotherms of binary metal ions simultaneously adsorbed onto biosorbents have not been thoroughly investigated to provide insight on involving mechanisms. This study explored the adsorption potential of untreated venus shells (UVS) that can be utilized in economical and environmentally-friendly ways. In this work, UVS of different sizes were prepared without chemical treatment as a biosorbent. Characterization of UVS was accomplished using nitrogen adsorption isotherm, FTIR, and SEM-EDX. Batch adsorption was carried out to study the effect of initial metal ion concentration, adsorbent dosage, and size on removing Cu(II) and Zn(II) from a binary solution of both metal ions using UVS. The experimental values of maximum adsorption capacities of Cu(II) and Zn(II) were 0.446 and 0.465 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption data were analyzed using the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion rate equations. The pseudo-second order and the intraparticle diffusion model yielded the best fit to the experimental data for Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, respectively. The equilibrium isotherm was examined using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R), and Elovich models. The Freundlich model best fits the Cu(II) and Zn(II) equilibrium adsorption data. The results indicated that the adsorption of Cu(II) and Zn(II) onto UVS-600 adsorbent could undergo a chemisorption mechanism. Both metal ions in an aqueous solution were competitively adsorbed onto the heterogeneous active sites available on the shell surfaces. Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions in the binary system could result in ionic interference between the adsorbed ions and the active sites. © 2022 The Author(s)",

  "abstract": "In this study, palm kernel shells were utilized in the gasification process to produce syngas. In addition, biochar prepared from pyrolysis of the left-over mangosteen and durian peels were used in the gasification process to enhance the tar removal efficiency. The expected outcomes of this study could result in not only the generation of renewable energy from but also the waste utilization of agricultural residues. The effect of catalysts and biochar on the syngas quality improvement were particularly studied. Palm kernel shell was used as raw material. The compositions and heating values of the biomass were characterized by the proximate, ultimate, and bomb analyses, respectively. Syngas was produced from a downdraft gasifier connected with catalytic and adsorption units in sequence. The gasification process was operated with 1 kg of palm shell per batch at a fixed air flow rate of 25 L/min. The NiO/CaO (10 %wt) catalysts on ceramic supporter with various NiO contents of 2%, 4%, and 8% were synthesized by co-impregnation. Biochars were synthesized by pyrolysis process of durian and mangosteen peels at around 300 - 500 oC for 2 hrs. Morphology and compositions of the synthesized catalysts and biochar were analyzed. The results of SEM analysis showed that the NiO and CaO were deposited and well dispersed on the porous ceramic ring supporters. The presence of active NiO on the catalyst was also confirmed in FTIR result with (wavelength of 692 cm-1). Biochar from durian and mangosteen peels, with BET surface area of 0.9219 - 0.9989 m2/g and adsorption pore size of 11.193 - 11.912 nm, were obtained from a pyrolysis process at 400 - 700 OC. The syngas samples were collected from the gasification unit every 15 min to 60 min. The gas chromatography was used to analyze the syngas compositions. The GC results indicated that increasing NiO contents in the catalysts tended to result in increasing CH4 composition of the syngas for both systems with and without biochar. With tar filtration unit containing biochar, the ability of tar removal was significantly increased by 2 to 9 times comparing to the system without biochar. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

  "abstract": "The rapid growth of energy demand and consumption from fossil fuels has been of great concern since the last decade. Renewable energy, including biogas production from wastes, has been studied to ease up the energy crisis problems. This study aims to synthesize bio-cellulose acetate (CA) membranes from agricultural waste and to study its efficiency in the removal of CO2 from biogas. The bio-CA membranes were synthesized from acetylation of bacterial cellulose (BC) and obtained from coconut juice residues (CJRs). The results showed that both chemical and physical characteristics of the bio-CA membrane were compared with those of the chemical CA membranes. The CO2 removal capacity of the bio-CA membranes was tested in a membrane separation unit. The maximum CO2 selectivity of 29.53 was achieved when using the bio-CA membrane with a thickness of 0.05 mm under the feed pressure of 0.1 MPa. Thick CA membranes exhibited better CO2 selectivity performance, particularly at low operating pressure. However, the CO2/CH4 separation factor decreased in the high-pressure region, probably because of the plasticization of the gas components. Eco-efficiency was evaluated to determine the optimal process conditions. In terms of eco-efficiency, the results suggested that the optimal condition was a bio-CA membrane of 0.05-mm thickness and pressure of 0.1 MPa. The implication of this study is promoting a zero-waste environment in which the agricultural residues could be potentially used in the synthesis of high-value CA membranes for biogas purification applications in energy production. © Copyright © 2021 Khamwichit, Wattanasit and Dechapanya.",

The durian and mangosteen peels residues were pyrolyzed at 400–600°C for 2 h to prepare biochar to be used as tar adsorbent. The BET surface area of obtained biochar was 0.9219–0.9989 m2/g with a range of adsorption pore size of 11.193–11.912 nm.

With the presence of biochar, the amount of tar captured in the filter unit was significantly increased up to nine times compared to the system without biochar. © Copyright © 2020 Dechapanya, Rattanahirun and Khamwichit.",

  "abstract": "To reduce carbon dioxide emissions from traditional drying methods, this research investigated the use of microwave technology for drying Standard Thai Rubber (STR) in Thailand. Commercial microwave ovens were modified and integrated with the microwave emitting power control system to maintain the appropriate temperature levels to evaporate the moisture from rubber. Throughout the drying process, the temperature of the rubber was measured both internally and outside. The results revealed that STR5L and STR20 could be dried satisfactorily and met the requirements for standard Thai rubber properties by utilizing 500 W for 140 and 120 min, respectively. By keeping the temperatures less than 150 °C, rubbers’ molecular structure is not destroyed from internal heat stress. Although utilizing less power for a longer period of time is possible, more energy was used, which is unfavorable. Compared to traditional hot air drying technologies, which take approximately 4–6 h for the drying process, microwave technology potentially reduces the drying time by half or more. If solar energy is used to supply electrical energy, 300,000 tons of Carbon dioxide can potentially be eliminated annually in the STR drying industry in Thailand by promoting approximately 1115 MW of Photovoltaic technology installations with the solar resources in southern Thailand. © 2022 by the authors.",

  "abstract": "In this study, cross-laminated timber (CLT) was manufactured from rubberwood via hot pressing. The effects of manufacturing parameters, such as resin content and clamping pressure, on the following properties of CLT panels were investigated: density (ρ), water absorption (WA), thickness swelling (TS), bonding strength (BS), compressive strength in the major strength direction of CLT (σmajor), compressive strength in the direction perpendicular to the flat plane of CLT (σFlat)), and rolling shear strength (RS). The relationships among the properties of the CLT panel, those the original rubberwood material, and the manufacturing parameters was also explored. The results showed that the resin content and clamping pressure did not significantly affect most of the examined properties of the CLT panels. The ρ, WA, σmajor, σFlat, and RS of the panels could be estimated directly from the properties of the original rubberwood, while the TS could be estimated directly from the clamping pressure applied on the panel. However, no such relationship was found for the BS value. Compared with typical softwood-CLT, the rubberwood-CLT exhibited superior mechanical properties. This implies that CLT made of rubberwood can achieve better structural performance than standard CLT can. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "An experimental study was carried out to develop and examine the properties of a new type of structural insulated panel (SIP). SIP prototypes conducted from this research consisted of insulated foam manufactured from natural rubber filled with wood particles as the core layer and three kinds of commercial wood-composite boards (plywood, cement particleboard, and fiber-cement board) as the surface layers. Polyurethane was used as an adhesive bond between the surface and the core layer. This preformed panel was placed into a clamping device and compressed until adhesive curing was achieved. The physical and mechanical properties of the SIP prototypes were consequently evaluated. The test results indicated that the types of surface layer materials played a significant effect on the SIP properties. The SIP covered with cement particleboard and fiber-cement board revealed high mechanical properties and high water resistance. The SIP prototype covered with plywood showed desirable properties (such as low density, high resistance of screw with-drawal, and low thermal transmittance). However, high water absorption and low fire resistance were drawbacks of the SIP covered with plywood. These properties should be improved. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

  "abstract": "The strength of an adhesive joint plays a major role in the implementation of engineering wood products; therefore, joint performance receives intense scrutiny. This study investigated a wooden adhesive joint, made from densified wood, the performance of which was dramatically enhanced. The wood sample was developed by performing mechanical compression and polymer impregnation on rubberwood. This treated rubberwood was additionally prepared by simple surface sanding prior to jointing. The highest wettability was found on surfaces sanded with the largest grit sandpaper. Consequently, glueline thickness increased with progressively larger grit (smaller grit number) sandpaper. In addition, the maximum shear strength for the joint made from the densified rubberwood was greater than that of that made from the original one, by 40%. Surprisingly, with the optimal sanding treatment, the shear strength of the wooden joint gradually increased with an increase in the density of the densified rubberwood from 1.05 to 1.30 g/cm3. Moreover, the rate of wood failure also increased throughout the stated density range. © 2022 by the authors.",

Various amounts of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were introduced into rubberwood tissues under the allowed environment. The embedded PMMA resulted to weight gaining up to about 60% and caused an increase in the density from 650 (for untreated rubberwood) to 1060 kg/m3 (for fully impregnated one). Additionally, scanning electron microscopic images revealed the evidence of the raising of PMMA amounts in the microstructure of treated rubberwood corresponding to the degrees of polymer impregnation. The embedded PMMA, from 0% to about 60% in wood tissues, enhanced water-resistant properties, i.e. the increasing in the surface contact angles for about 20 degrees, the improvement of water absorption for four times and the development of anti-swelling efficiency (ASE) for almost 20%, to the treated rubberwood. Mechanical properties, including shear, compressive and flexural strength of treated rubberwood were also gradually improved when higher levels of PMMA were incorporated into rubberwood. Moreover, the logarithm values of water absorption, ASE, shear strength and compressive strength revealed the linear tendency when the degree of impregnation was raised. This would provide an opportunity of treating rubberwood as a tuneable wood-polymer composite material for the designated applications. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

  "abstract": "According to the literature, an efficient method to improve properties of rubberwood to be suitable for structural use is still required. In this work, a novel densifying method for the development of high strength rubberwood for this application was introduced. The method consists of three main steps including pre-compression of rubberwood raw material, impregnation of pre-compressed rubberwood with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and mechanical compression of MMA-impregnated pre-compressed rubberwood. Effects of targeted compression ratios used during compression on the properties of the obtained rubberwood was explored. The result showed that the properties of the obtained rubberwood were dependent on the compression ratios and most of them had greatly improved compared with that of original rubberwood or densified rubberwood reported elsewhere. Interestingly, properties of the obtained densified rubberwood were higher compared with that of typical softwood and hardwood provided in a wood handbook. Note that, it is possible to scale up the proposed method to industrial production level because it requires simple steps. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "Surface modification of 1,4-polybutadiene and cis-1,4-polyisoprene to introduce polar functional groups provided surfaces that reconstructed reversibly against water as a function of temperature. These surfaces became hydrophobic in contact with hot water, but their original hydrophilicity returned upon equilibration against cold water. Repeated cycling between hot and cold water, however, led to a damping of this reversibility. A series of parallel experiments on both the interfacial and bulk behavior of these elastomers strongly indicated that this damping was due to the alignment of extended interfacial chains during temperature cycling and to a decay of the restoring force on the interfacial chains under extension. These studies thus demonstrate that the interfacial behavior of elastomers can display close analogies to the bulk viscoelastic properties of the solid.",

  "abstract": "This study was carried out to investigate the effect of pre-treatment and heat treatment at varied temperature and time on tensile and thermal behavior of Parawood strands. A three-way factorial experiment was employed with ten replications. The factors are (1) pre-treatment conditions of three levels (oven-dried strand, EMC strand, boiled strand), (2) temperature of heat treatment of four levels (170°C, 180°C, 190°C, 200°C) and (3) time of heat treatment of four levels (15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min). The specimens prepared from the heat-treated strands were tested in tension parallel to grain and analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, the specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to reveal its internal structure. The results indicated that the Parawood strands subjected to the pre-treatment by boiling in water (100°C) for 30 minutes and subsequently heat treated in a hot air oven at 190°C for 30 minutes yielded highest tensile strength of 57 MPa and highest toughness of 0.75 MPa. The resulted tensile strength and toughness of boiling pre-treated strands are about 30 and 79 percent higher than those of the oven-dried pre-treated strands, respectively. The specimens subjected to the aforementioned treatment also required highest capacity of endothermic heat of 215 J/g for decomposing its modified crystalline structure. This study suggested that the pre-treatment by boiling in water for 30 minutes, followed by heat treatment at 190°C for 30 minutes, could increase tensile strength and toughness of Parawood strands by increasing its modified crystalline regions (a cellulose crystalline region reinforced by hygrothermally modified lignin and hemicellulose molecules).",

  "abstract": "After oxidation of the surface of cross-linked cis-1,4-polyisoprene with aqueous permanganate, the composition of its interface with water depended on temperature. The polymer remained hydrophilic against cool water but became more hydrophobic against hot water. These changes depended upon the amount of cross-linking and on the amount of surface oxidation. They were also reversible when cycled between high and low temperature, and this reversibility disappeared only gradually over many cycles. The system independence of this behavior provided an important test of our hypothesis that the surface dynamics of elastomers can involve a competition between enthalpically favorable solvation of hydrophilic functional groups at the polymer/water interface and entropically unfavorable chain extension.",

  "abstract": "The effect of formaldehyde scavenger on the curing behavior, bonding strength, formaldehyde emission and chemical characteristics of urea-formaldehyde resin (UF) for the particleboard manufacturer were investigated. The formaldehyde scavenger was added to UF resin at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 % w/w. The cure behavior of UF resin on a wood substrate containing different formaldehyde scavenger content was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results indicated that the reaction enthalpy (δH) and peak temperature (Tpeak) decrease with the increase of formaldehyde scavenger content. Notable, the δH and Tpeak values decreased up to the formaldehyde scavenger content of 12 % w/w and then were rather constant with its further addition. To determine properties, the laboratory-made particleboards bonded with UF resin at various contents of formaldehyde scavenger were manufactured. The results showed that the addition of formaldehyde scavenger could improve bonding strength of the panels and greatly reduced their formaldehyde emission. The particleboard properties were relatively stable with the further addition of formaldehyde scavenger more than 12 % w/w. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FTIR) spectra of particleboards showed variations of methylene and methylene-ether bridges which were corresponded to the curing characteristic and board properties. The corrected area under absorbance of methylene bridge increased with the increasing of formaldehyde scavenger content.",

  "abstract": "The occurrence of a penis in female gastropods of the superfamily Muricoidea (infraorder Neogastropoda) has commonly been accepted as an indicator of tributyltin (TBT) pollution. Some species seem less sensitive than others, and one belonging to the family Columbellidae has been reported that it lacks the imposex response. During a survey in South-east Asian waters, females of Cymbiola nobilis and Melo melo (family Volutidae) with a small penis and an external vas deferens were initially considered as showing imposex. Doubt arose when 100% of the females had a penis on sites where other gastropods showed no or a low imposex incidence. During the present study, several hypotheses could be rejected such as (1) that the volutes are extremely sensible for TBT; (2) due to a high age they have a higher chance of coming into contact with TBT; or (3) they have a sex change during growth. This induced us to search for museum specimens collected before 1960, which date is long before TBT was brought into use as biocide in anti-fouling paint on ships. In the Australian Museum in Sydney and the Zoological Museum in Amsterdam some species were found from Indonesian and Australian waters. All inspected females showed the typical small penis and vas deferens by which it became clear that it is not TBT induced, but a natural phenomenon in these species. This is unknown in other muricoids. The \"pseudo-imposex\" has been established in Cymbiola nobilis, C. vespertilio, Melo amphora, M. melo and M. umbilicata. These species belong to the Volutidae subfamily Cymbiinae. However, male characters in females seem missing in species belonging to the subfamilies Odontocymbiolinae and Zidoninae from South America; they show a normal TBT- induced imposex response according recent literature.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed at investigating (1) the characteristics of self-regulated learning (SRL) among low proficiency EFL students and (2) the variation for SRL among students with different English proficiency. Participants were 85 Thai university students who were categorized as low proficiency EFL students based on their Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) score. These students were divided into two groups: G1 and G2. The results revealed that students in the G1 group had a significantly lower TOEIC score than the students in the G2 group. For the investigation of SRL, the exploratory factor analyses (EFA) demonstrated ten subscales: Five for motivational and five for learning strategy factors. Multiple regressions that determined the influences of SRL on proficiency revealed that the students who possessed higher task value and intrinsic goal orientation were more proficient. On the contrary, if the students had higher test anxiety, they were less proficient. Students in the G1 and G2 groups differed significantly for extrinsic goal orientation. The students in the G2 group (with higher TOEIC score) had more extrinsic goal orientation than did the G1 group students. For Learning strategy in SRL, a multiple regression for learning strategy factors revealed that there were correlations between elaboration and critical thinking and proficiency of Thai EFL students. This factor was a significant predictor of the variation of proficiency. Significant differences were also found between the G1 and G2 groups in peer learning. The lower proficient group tended to rely more on their peers and seek for help. For pedagogical implications, teachers need to provide motivational environments in order to improve the mental state of low proficiency students. Attention should be paid to students who cannot perform well in class in order to raise their confidence and lessen anxiety in learning English.

Old oil palm trunks (OPT) squeezed sap, the agricultural wastes on replanting and pruning of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), contained mainly glucose and fructose as a potential feedstock to use as a vast carbon source for LA production. To improve the LA yield and productivity, various fermentation modes were performed by Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 10863 using OPT sap as a basal medium.

In saline sites, sap significantly (p < 0.05) increased in total soluble solids and sugar concentration. The total amino acid in the saline site was higher than in the other sites. The fresh Jak sap was rich in functional nutrients such as sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose, starchyose, galactose, arabinose, maltose), organic acids (niacin, succinic, tartaric, malic, citric, lactic, acetic acids), minerals (P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni, B), essential amino acids (arginine, lysine, valine, histidine, threonine), seven non-essential amino acids (i.e. glutamic acid) and vitamins (B1, B3, B6, B12, E). Furthermore, potassium was significantly increased in salinity soil, and the decrease in potassium was associated with the increase in sodium. Fresh Jak sap from all salinity soils was shown to be an excellent source of several nutritional elements in this investigation. However, it appeared that Jak sap from the non saline site would be the best choice for use in the development of healthy food products. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

  "abstract": "This study utilized historical radiosonde data from 37 selected WMO stations to analyze the physical properties of Southeast Asian lower atmosphere in both spatial and temporal regimes. The proposed analysis method includes the estimation of static atmospheric parameters and their correlations, the trend analysis from the parameters’ time series, and the extraction of annual and interannual variations from the detrended parameters’ time series. The vertical structure analysis of temperature and pressure “profiles” (i.e., temperature and pressure as functions of altitude at a given time) shows that their residuals from the isentropic atmosphere are altitude-dependent and predictable. The correlation analysis between estimated parameters shows that the heat capacity ratio is a function of the environmental lapse rate, which can be used in the parameterization of the atmospheric model. The molar mass of the Southeast Asian lower atmosphere was also estimated from the parameterization to be 29.65 g/mol, slightly higher than that of the average value of dry air at 28.97 g/mol. The spatial analysis of their average values indicates that the Southeast Asian lower atmosphere can be zonally classified into the Northern Equatorial Subregion (NES) and Central Equatorial Subregion (CES), where their boundary is located between the latitude of 5° N to 10° N. The trend analysis of each parameter’s time series suggests that the Southeast Asian lower atmosphere is a transient system manipulated by climate oscillations and climate change. Their equilibrium values can be estimated using linear regression analysis. The results from the Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis also suggest that the annual variation originated from the Brewer-Dobson Circulation (BDC) and the interannual variation was manipulated by climate oscillations such as the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO). This knowledge can be used to adjust the isentropic model to suit applications requiring accurate approximation, parameterize the model without sacrificing accuracy, and study the effect of climate oscillations and climate change on the Southeast Asian lower atmosphere. © 2023, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "This paper describes a case study of an online physics laboratory course implemented for 254 engineering students at Walailak University in Thailand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The laboratory sequence was designed based on the United Kingdom Professional Standards Framework and covered eight experiments on fundamental concepts of motion, electricity, waves, and fluid mechanics. The experiments were conducted at students' homes using physics education technology simulations, Tracker for video analysis, smartphones, and home-based apparatuses. During the experiments, students shared their progress with classmates and lecturers through screen sharing, which facilitated exchanges of ideas and difficulties. The paper discusses the successful implementation of the online laboratory course and the challenges encountered, such as student engagement, resource limitations, and practical skill development. The insights gained from this case study may be useful for online laboratory education beyond the pandemic. © 2023 Open and Distance Learning Association of Australia, Inc.",

  "abstract": "Combining various types of ferrites brings about magnetic properties desirable for different applications. This study aims to modify barium hexaferrite (BaFe12O19) by physically mixing it with cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4). BaFe12O19/CoFe2O4 magnets were produced by ball-milling and pressing solegel-derived ferrite powders. The ferrite composites showed variations in magnetic properties from BaFe12O19 magnets with a saturation magnetization of 69.46 emu/g and a maximum energy product of 0.4529 MGOe. For the BaFe12O19:CoFe2O4 weight ratio of 4:1, both saturation and remanent magnetizations were increased due to the addition of CoFe2O4 with high magnetizations. However, the magnetizations were reduced when the BaFe12O19:CoFe2O4 ratio was reduced to 2:1. On the other hand, the coercivity was monotonously decreased with increasing CoFe2O4. Interestingly, the maximum energy product in this study was linearly decreased with the bulk density of the magnets from 3.59 to 3.15 g/cm3. It is concluded that magnetic properties could be modified from a facile physical mixing of ferrites. © 2023 University of Kerbala.

  "abstract": "In this study, a microwave extractor was successfully developed by simulating the waves and electric fields in a heating chamber. The chamber size and positions of the magnetrons were determined to maximize the heating in the microwave extractor. The results from the COMSOL Multiphysics software were used to construct the microwave extractor. Microwave-assisted solvent extraction was then performed on Kaempferia parviflora rhizomes. The highest total flavonoid and phenolic contents of 258.81 ± 1.01 µg quercetin equivalents per ml sample and 120.69 ± 0.75 µg gallic acid equivalents per ml sample, respectively, were achieved by extraction in methanol solvent at 83 °C within 2.5 min. These values were higher than those obtained from ultrasound-assisted extraction for 30 min and Soxhlet extraction for 60 min. In addition, the extraction time of 5,7-dimethoxyflavone using the Soxhlet extractor, which was approximately 1 h, was reduced to 2 min using the microwave extractor. These results demonstrated that microwaves are an outstanding heat source for extracting bioactive compounds and exhibit potential for commercial applications. Computer simulations were performed to provide insights into microwave heating. This information could be used to overcome technical challenges in industrial processes. © 2022 THE AUTHORS",

  "abstract": "Plasma-activated water (PAW) is increasingly used as an antimicrobial washing agent in biomedical and agricultural industries. In this study, an industrial prototype plasma jet utilizing an adjustable 500 W radio frequency (RF) power supply was developed for generating reactive species in water. A laboratory-scale plasma jet was firstly set up to test the effect of plasma on water. After activating 100 mL tap water by air plasma for 60 min, over 500 mg/L nitrate (NO3–) and 5 mg/L nitrite NO2− were obtained consistent with the increased electrical conductance and the pH reduction. For the industrial prototype, 60 ppm of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was obtained from the activation of 300 mL water for 120 min. Substituting air by argon drastically increased the H2O2 concentration. Although the water substantially evaporated during the plasma activation in vacuum, the low-pressure chamber is advantageous in enhancing H2O2 generation. With the water circulation, the PAW can continuously be produced with sufficient reactive species using a shorter activation time. The pressure and the type of gas, as well as the frequency and power in plasma generation, are all adjustable. Cost-effective PAW for industrial sanitization and other research purposes, including stimulation of seed germination and plant growth, can be generated by this flexible system. © 2022, Publishing House of the Romanian Academy.

  "abstract": "The combination of cobalt ferrite and natural rubber has a potential to enhance the functional properties of rubber ferrite composites available on the market. In this study, cobalt ferrite was synthesized by the sol-gel method with tapioca starch as a cheating agent and then incorporated into natural rubber using an internal mixer. The curing characteristics, magnetic hysteresis, complex permeability, and permittivity of the rubber ferrite composites were studied as a function of the loading from 0 to 25 phr. The cure time and scorch time tended to reduce with the addition of non-reinforced cobalt ferrite fillers. The remanent and saturation magnetizations were linearly proportional to the cobalt ferrite loading, consistent with the rule of mixture. On the other hand, the increase in cobalt ferrite loading from 5 to 25 phr slightly affected the coercive field and the complex permeability. Using the maximum loading of 25 phr, both real and imaginary parts of the permittivity were significantly raised and reduced with the frequency in the 10-300 MHz range. © 2023 Techno-Press, Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Permanent magnets of varying shapes and sizes are increasingly produced. For hexaferrite magnets, it is challenging to incorporate polymers and a soft magnetic phase in the form of paste before injection molding or extrusion free-forming. In this study, hard magnetic barium hexaferrite/soft magnetic iron composites with a density of 2.28–2.34 g/cm3 are obtained after paste-injection molding and subsequent sintering at 1150 °C for 5 h. Variations of the binder (143.5–287.0 mg poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA) and the plasticizer (75–150 mg poly(ethylene glycol), PEG-400) in the ceramic–polymer paste give rise to comparable remanent magnetization (33.10–33.63 emu/g) and coercivity (3854–3857 Oe). Unlike all-ferrite systems, the presence of a soft magnetic metal phase is not detrimental to the coercivity. However, the remanent and saturation magnetizations are not substantially increased. The addition of 1% and 5% of iron oxide in the ceramic–polymer paste gives rise to hard/soft composites with lower densities of 2.11 and 2.14 g/cm3. The coercivity is increased to 3942–3945 Oe; however, the maximum energy product is reduced. © 2022 by the authors.",

  "abstract": "This smartphone colorimetry investigated RGB (red, green and blue), HSV (hue, saturation and value of brightness) and CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and key) color parameters for characterizing bloodstains. Blood samples, separately deposited on cotton cloths and tissue papers, were analyzed by the ‘Colorimeter X’ application on an iPhone XR after 1, 5, 7, 9 and 11 days. The reductions in RGB and V values recorded by the smartphone application are consistent with darker bloodstain over time. Bloodstain colors are sensitive to the substrate and person-to-person variation, but a similar correlation with time could be established by a linear least squares fitting. With the highest coefficient of determination averaged from four samples, the V value is the most effective parameter for describing bloodstain ageing. For other color spaces, the R and K almost match the V value in measuring the bloodstains. Because these three values may be susceptible to the deviation in the measurement, the B value is suggested as an additional parameter in the bloodstain characterization. This small-scale study demonstrates the potential of colorimetric parameters in an on-site analysis by a cost-effective smartphone. © 2023 The Author(s).

This article reviewed achievements in transforming ubiquitous smartphones into cost-effective scientific instruments for educational laboratories, environmental studies, point-of-care diagnostics, home-based health monitoring, and rehabilitation. Magnetic fields were precisely measured by built-in magnetometers, leading to demonstrations for engineering and medical applications. The smartphone-based joint-angle measurement was a viable alternative to traditional goniometers. Characterizations of optical signals captured by cameras led to portable spectrophotometers and colorimeters for both educational and practical uses. Interestingly, smartphones became a platform for high-resolution microscopes and fluorescence microscopes were developed with add-on components.

Dry and fresh alginate beads were prepared by changing ZnO contents in the range of 0.5, 1, and 2% (w/w) and then characterized for their morphology as well as dye removal. The dye removal efficiency was increased by increasing the active surface area of the alginate beads and ZnO photocatalytic activity. Under ultraviolet irradiation for 24 h, the dye removal efficiency reached 64% in the case of 2% ZnO loading. The use of alginate beads dried at 80 °C before ZnO loading increased the maximum value to 78%. With more than 20% removal during the first 2 h through the adsorption and diffusion, the dye removal of alginate beads incorporating 1 and 2% ZnO was modeled as a function of time according to the Weber-Morris intra-particle diffusion equation. The dye adsorption per mass of the adsorbent having 0 and 0.5% ZnO loading fitted the Elovich equation better. © 2022 The Author(s).

  "abstract": "Video analysis is carried out for one-dimensional motion and collision experiments using Tracker. Physical variables, i.e. displacement, time, and velocity, can be deducted from the analysis and allows one to connect them to the equation of motion and energy conservation. Corresponding equations of motions are given without neglecting the effect of friction and air resistance. Their solutions are used as models for data-fitting purposes. The fitting results allow one to find the surface friction coefficient and the air resistance parameter for the first experiment and friction for the second experiment. These experiments and analyses can be implemented for at least sophomore-level physics in a university. However, if simplified by removing all resistant parts, they can be used for high-school or first-year students in a university. The video files can be distributed to students for online courses that are prevalently ongoing worldwide due to the COVID pandemic. Students can observe the experiments and analyse data at home. With scheduled online consulting sessions, students can conduct the analysis with helps from instructors.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

  "abstract": "The partial substitution by bismuth (Bi) is aimed to improve magnetic properties of barium hexaferrites from the sol–gel auto-combustion synthesis. The exceptionally high saturation magnetization of 99 emu/g is attributed to the substitution of Fe3+ in tetrahedral 4f1 sites by Bi3+and the highly compact structure without impurity phase. On the other hand, the coercivity is reduced with increasing Bi substitution because the hexagonal particles grow larger and single magnetic domains become multi-domains. Similarly, the co-substitution by bismuth-copper (Bi-Cu) ions substantially enhances the particle size and hence the reduction in coercivity is even more drastic. The reduction in coercivity of barium hexaferrites with high magnetizations are desirable for microwave absorbing and data storage materials. The magnetizations of barium hexaferrites with either Bi or Bi-Cu substitutions follow the law of approach saturation. However, the saturation magnetization is significantly lower by the Bi-Cu substitutions into octahedral 4f2 sites and the presence of the secondary hematite phase. © 2021 The Author(s)",

  "abstract": "Ceramic–polymer paste-injection molding is demonstrated as a facile fabrication route for barium hexaferrite magnets. Interestingly, these low-density (1.90–2.35 g/cm3 ) magnets exhibit substantial coercivity of 3868–4002 Oe. When ceramic paste without polymeric additives is used, reduced coercivity and slightly increased magnetizations are obtained from a magnet with the density of 2.55 g/cm3 . Their magnetizations are also higher than those obtained from compactions of sol–gel-derived powders. For compact magnets (3.46–3.77 g/cm3 ), the DI water addition results in a slightly higher magnetization but lower coercivity than dry-pressed magnets. Compactions into disk and bar magnets give rise to comparable magnetic properties. The morphological characterizations reveal smaller barium hexaferrite particles leading to larger coercivity, and the density and shape of magnets have a less pronounced effect. © 2022 by the authors.

  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to modernize batik clothes, a cultural heritage of Southeast Asia, through creative design, color characterization, and collection presentation. Three community enterprises from the southern regions of Thailand participated in designing batik motifs based on their local identities. The pattern of the first manufacturer group was influenced by stones and ancient beads of vivid orange and blue shades. The second community was inspired by the nearby sea, resulting in ocean blue, white, and emerald green colors on batik fabrics. Floras in the south of Thailand dominated the design of the final manufacturer group. Smartphone colorimetry was then used to characterize the batik fabrics. It was demonstrated that this proposed color quantification was not confined to the laboratory, and could easily be carried out by vendors or customers. The collaboration encouraged local batik artisans to use a variety of inspirations, new tools, as well as professional design and production methods. To introduce modernized batik to the public, collections of these newly designed clothes were displayed in a fashion show staged under the theme “Southern Chic.” The presentation of Thai batik clothes in seasonal collections highlighted the transformations of local manufacturers and products with increasing appeal to younger people. In addition to conservation and commercial advantages, the modernized approach is accessible and attractive for education purposes, engaging students in cultural heritage. © 2021 by the authors.

  "abstract": "Silver (Ag) nanospheres were chemically reduced from 1 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3) solutions using mulberry (Morus alba Linn.) leaf extracts. The increase of pH in the synthesis from 9 to 13 modified the surface plasmon resonance peak in UV-Vis spectra relating to the particle diameter around 20 nm. Smaller nanoparticles were obtained from the syntheses at pH 7.4-7.7 and their density was slightly increased with the increase in synthesis temperature from 25 °C to 90 °C. The particle size was increased with increasing AgNO3 concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 M but the mixed phases were obtained from the 0.5 M AgNO3 precursor. After storing for 10 months at room temperature, the nanosuspensions remained without Ag sediment but their colors had significantly changed due to particle agglomerations. The colors were characterized by the smartphone colorimetry according to the RGB, CIE space, as well as chroma and hue angle. Based on the chroma and CIE b* values, the effect of synthesis pH in the stored nanosuspensions was comparable to that before the storage. Although the temperature had only moderate effects, nanosuspensions synthesized at 25 °C, 80 °C, and 90 °C were clearly distinguished by the hue and CIE b* values. © 2021 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

The induction melting of manganese (Mn) and aluminum (Al), and subsequent annealing at 450, 500, or 550 °C for 20 min, gave rise to ferromagnetic τ-MnAl phase, as well as other phases. The nonmagnetic Al4C3 and oxide phases were then removed by the magnetic separation. Magnetic powders from the magnetic separation were incorporated in polylactic acid (PLA) matrix via a solution route. The remanent magnetization as high as 4.3 emu/g in the powder form was reduced to 2.3-2.6 emu/g in the composites. The reduction in coercivity was minimal, and the largest value of 814 Oe was obtained when the powder annealed at 450 °C was loaded in the composite. The phase composition and hence magnetic properties were even more sensitive to the carbon (C) doping. Interestingly, the addition of 3% C led to coercivity as high as 1445 Oe in MnAl-C powders without further annealing. The enhanced coercivity was attributed to the domain wall pinning by the AlMn3C phase, and magnetizations are likely increased by this phase. © 2021 by the authors.

Subsequent heat treatments at 450 °C and 1050 °C result in irregularly shaped na-noparticles characterized as the M-type BaFe12O19 with the secondary phase of hematite (α-Fe2O3). Despite the mixed phase, the substantial coercivity of 2626 Oe and magnetization as high as 74.8 emu/g are obtained in this undoped ferrite. The copper (Cu) doing strongly affects morphology and magnetic properties of BaFe12−xCuxO19 (x = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5). The majority of particles become micro-rods for x = 0.1 and microplates in the case of x = 0.3 and 0.5. The coercivity and magnetization tend to reduce as Cu2+ increasingly substitutes Fe3+.

  "abstract": "The potential of microwave drying in the production of rehydrated foods is demonstrated with stink beans (Parkia speciosa), smelly legumes of Africa and Asia. Compared to stink beans dehydrated by convective drying and freeze drying, the microwave products exhibit higher moisture contents, but the distribution of microscopic pores leads to good rehydration characteristics. Dehydration by microwave drying is also achieved within a much shorter period than that commonly used in freeze drying. The dehydration time can be further reduced to 6 h comparable to convective drying, and the moisture content is dropped to 11% by decreasing the pressure during microwave drying. However, the rehydration time remains around 65 min for products from both ambient and low-pressure (400 Pa) microwave drying. In rehydration, the period is successfully reduced to 30 min by increasing the water temperature to 70◦ C. The results indicate that microwave drying does not affect the value of crude protein and rehydrated products are comparable to fresh stink beans. From these findings, the microwave drying technique is an applicable technology for both manufacturers and consumers, with acceptable drying time and rehydration characteristics. © 2021 by the authors.

  "abstract": "Solution–processing methods were investigated as viable alternatives to produce the polymer-bonded barium hexaferrite (BaM). BaM powders were first synthesized by using the sol-gel auto-combustion method. While the ignition period in two synthesis batches varied, the morphology of hexagonal microplates and nanorods, as well as magnetic properties, were reproduced. To prepare magnetic polymer composites, these BaM powders were then incorporated into the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) matrix with a weight ratio of 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40 by using the solution casting method. Magnetizations were linearly decreased with a reduction in ferrite loading. Compared to the BaM loose powders and pressed pellet, both remanent and saturation magnetizations were lower and gave rise to comparable values of the squareness. The squareness around 0.5 of BaM samples and their composites revealed the isotropic alignment. Interestingly, the coercivity was significantly increased from 1727–1776 Oe in loose BaM powders to 1874–2052 Oe for the BaM-ABS composites. These composites have potential to be implemented in the additive manufacturing of rare-earth-free magnets. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

  "abstract": "The force between permanent magnets implemented in many engineering devices remains an intriguing problem in basic physics. The variation of magnetic force with the distance x between a pair of magnets cannot usually be approximated as x–4 because of the dipole nature and geometry of magnets. In this work, the force between two identical cylindrical magnets is accurately described by a closed-form solution. The analytical model assumes that the magnets are uniformly magnetized along their length. The calculation, based on the magnetic field exerted by one magnet on the other along the direction of their orientation, shows a reduction in the magnetic force with the distance x and a dependence on the size parameters of magnets. To verify the equation, the experiment was set up by placing two cylindrical neodymium iron boron type magnets in a vertical tube. The repulsive force between the identical upper and lower magnets of 2.5 cm in diameter and 7.5 cm in length was measured from the weight on the top of the upper magnet. The resulting separation between the magnets was recorded as x. The forces measured at x = 0.004-0.037 m differ from the values calculated using the analytic solution by-0.55 % to-13.60 %. The calculation also gives rise to a practical remnant magnetic field of 1.206 T. When x is much larger than the length of magnets, the equation of force is approximated as a simple form proportional to 1/x–4. The finding can be directly used in magnetic levitation as well as applied in calculating magnetic fields and forces in other systems incorporating permanent magnets. © The Author(s) 2021.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we present the magnetic refrigeration by magnetocaloric effect, for which the magnetic flux distribution has been modified in the Halbach cylinder. The insertion of a soft magnetic rod in the bore led to the alternating magnetic field with two regions of high flux density for magnetization and two regions of low flux density for demagnetization of magnetocaloric materials in the annular gap. The two-dimensional numerical simulations by the finite element method using COMSOL Multiphysics and Poisson SUPERFISH demonstrated the substitution effect of neodymium–iron–boron permanent magnets by soft magnetic low-carbon steels. The optimized soft magnetic cross-sectional area of 0.04 m2 in the Halbach cylinder gave the maximum flux density of 2 T in the air gap, comparable to the peak field of existing prototypes. The flux density is further increased and became the largest when the ratio of external to internal radius of the cylinder is at the maximum. The cooling performance is also affected by the size of the cylinder, and the substantial value is obtained in a practical design with reserved air gap for magnetocaloric materials. © 2020, The National Academy of Sciences, India.",

  "abstract": "Carbon pastes were applied in fabricating screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) for versatile electrochemical analyses. The electrochemical behaviour of the homemade system, consists of a working electrode, a counter electrode and a reference electrode, was investigated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of ferricyanide at a low concentration. The homemade SPCEs gave standard CV characteristics with sensitive electrochemical behaviours. Due to the surface roughness, the cathodic and anodic current peaks (Ipc and Ipa ) of the homemade SPCEs were significantly higher than those of commercial DropSens 110 SPCEs at a 90 % confidence level (P value 0.1). However, the reproducibility of homemade SPCEs (n=3) by manual pasting was lower than commercial DropSens 110. The novelty in making electrodes on a polyester substrate by using carbon pastes substantially reduces the production cost. The materials and process used for these homemade SPCEs show potential for a variety of electrochemical sensors. © 2021, Universiti Malaysia Perlis. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Digital image processing is increasingly influential in the inspection of industrial products. For microelectronic industry, the pattern examination required for photolithographic masks can be facilitated by the image segmentation. This work demonstrates that arrays of rectangular chromium films on photolithographic masks are effectively detected by the gradient-based edge detection. The RGB micrographs are successively converted to grayscale and binary images. The closing morphology algorithm is then applied to reduce noise in the images before the application of the Canny edge detector. After subsequent steps of fill area and remove small objects, the area of each rectangle can then be computed. This image processing procedure gives rise to less than 0.8% difference from the one-by-one inspection and the ratios of rectangular areas confirmed the high accuracy. The standard deviations in number of pixels averaged from 10-17 rectangles in three images are 0.81-1.89% indicating the precision of photolithography and image processing. The brightness used in this optical microscopy has no apparent effect but the precision and accuracy are significantly reduced in the image with low magnification and different illumination. © 2006-2021 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

  "abstract": "Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) image processing is implemented in the spatial distribution analysis of iron-platinum based nanoparticles, drop-casting on diethylene glycol (DEG). Before the redispersion in hexane with surfactant additions, these magnetic particles aggregate in the nanosuspension after a prolonged storage. The precise analysis of aggregations by conventional methods is not possible but the complication can be overcome in this work. Despite the aggregation, image processing with the Canny algorithm can separate the edges of overlapping nanoparticles resulting in comparable particle size determination before and after the redispersion. The distributions on DEG are compared in terms of the surface coverage. The nanosuspension without redispersion gives rise to the highest surface coverage around 0.28 since a large number of nanoparticles are either aggregated or in close contacts. Smaller numbers of nanoparticles from redispersed nanosuspensions are detected in each TEM image. Whereas the redispersed nanosuspension of 0.2 mg/mL still contains some nanoparticle stacking, the higher concentration of 0.3 mg/mL results in the lowest surface coverage of 0.18 as nanoparticles are well dispersed on DEG without overlapping and stacking. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

The challenges in developments of these rare-earth-free magnets are to acquire a high remanence and coercivity from the ferromagnetic τ-phase in MnAl alloys. To this end, the phase transformation to this τ-MnAl with L10 body centered tetragonal structure has been promoted by a variety of methods and a few percents of carbon (C) is often added to prevent the phase decomposition. Magnetization and coercivity are not only influenced by the phase composition but also the microstructure. The fabrication processes and factors affecting the phase and microstructure are therefore covered. Finally, the productions of bulk MnAl magnets are addressed. © 2020. Techno-Press, Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Implementation of manganese-bismuth (MnBi) alloys as high-performance permanent magnets is a challenge for physicists and engineers because the ferromagnetic low-temperature phase (LTP) is not exclusively obtained. In this work, melting powered by four commercial magnetrons of 2000–2500 W in a microwave furnace is demonstrated as a new route to alloy MnBi. Under an argon atmosphere, microwave heating transferred to pieces of broken Bi ingots and Mn flakes for 2 h gave rise to products of inhomogeneous composition and morphology. Scanning electron micrographs were classified into three regions according to morphology and elemental composition. Cubic-like clusters characterized as Mn precipitated over light solidified Bi-rich regions, and the MnBi phase was formed in homogeneous regions with a balanced composition between Mn and Bi. A ferromagnetic hysteresis loop was obtained in the ground powder with a coercivity of 40 kA/m. Subsequent annealing at 553 K under a pressure of 414 kPa for 12 h enhanced the MnBi phase with extended regions of balanced composition. It follows that the coercivity was increased to 60 kA/m. However, remanent magnetization was slightly reduced. This MnBi alloyed by microwave radiation can be further used in rare-earth-free magnets. © 2020, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

The inhibition of Aspergillus sp. growth on tube sedge basketry by zinc oxide (ZnO) was demonstrated. ZnO nanoparticles synthesized with chitosan capping agents were analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The crystallite size consistent with electron microscope images and surface area of ZnO were dependent on the amounts of chitosan. ZnO exhibited a large ultraviolet (UV) absorbance in an entire 200-400 nm range when large crystallites agglomerated into bulky aggregates. In the case of small amounts of chitosan used, small crystallites tending to agglomerate in close contacts enhanced antifungal activity on pieces of tube sedge basketry. The fungi inhibition by this chitosan-modified ZnO was attributed to the stress response in fungal hyphae and generation of hydrogen peroxide. © 2020 University of Kashan.",

  "abstract": "A smartphone and a commercial mobile application named ‘Colorimeter’ are combined for the colour classification of fine-paste ware used in Hindu-Buddhist rituals. With high L* values in the CIE colour space, the potsherds from 3 Buddhist temples as well as an ancient production site in southern Thailand are consistent with the white fine-paste ware. By contrast, the artefacts from an archaeological in north Sumatra of Indonesia are characterized by much lower L* and b*. Classified as the red fine-paste ware, the artefacts from Myanmar and India exhibit uniquely high a* values at their outer layer. The RGB space as well as chroma and hue angle can complement the CIE space in describing colours of religious artefacts but they are only effective in the case of distinct colours. © 2020, Ecozone, OAIMDD.

In this paper, magnetite (Fe3O4) dispersed in hexane are investigated. Synthesized by the reduction of ferric acetylacetonate, nanoparticles including nanocubes are obtained with the average size of 13.7 nm. Their dispersion only slightly modifies the wettability and viscosity of hexane. By contrast, the viscosity of the magnetic fluid is significantly increased from 0.284 to 0.339 cP when the U-tube viscometer was subjected to 142 Oe magnetic field from an electromagnet. This magnetoviscosity is attributed to the interaction between nanoparticles in response to the applied magnetic field.

  "abstract": "Polypropylene (PP) was investigated as a polymeric matrix of functional composites by melt mixing in a compression mould. The sample with 15 wt.% loading of cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) increases the electrical permittivity as a result of Maxwell-Wagner effect and induces ferrimagnetic properties in PP composites. By increasing the CoFe2O4 loading to 55 wt.%, the magnetization and relative permittivity were substantially raised. Interestingly, this high loading which was comparable to the percolation threshold, did not affect the coercivity. Both low and high CoFe2O4 loadings have insignificant effects on magnetic permeability spectra. The results suggest that the melt mixing is a facile route to incorporate high loading of magnetic powder into plastics, leading to composites of enhanced electromagnetic properties. © 2019, Universiti Malaysia Perlis.

  "abstract": "The combination of synchrotron X-ray absorption and electron microscopy provided information on the production and exchange of fine-paste ware (FPW), dated to around the 11th to 14th centuries in peninsular Thailand and maritime Southeast Asia. White FPW sherds from Kota Cina in north Sumatra, a well-known trading city in Indonesia, have similar clay composition to those from Kok Moh on Satingphra Spit in peninsular Thailand. Also, homogeneous texture indicating high firing temperatures was found in the samples from Kota Cina as well as in those from Phra Mahathat Temple and Suan Luang Temple in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province in Thailand. However, the split Mn K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) peaks are exclusively observed in the samples from Nakhon Si Thammarat. The distinctly large compositions of α-Fe2O3 and carbon, respectively confirmed by Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra, suggest that Nakhon Si Thammarat probably had at least a FPW production site in which the ash glazing process may have been implemented. The evidence of such process is not found in the samples from other sites in maritime Southeast Asia in this analysis. © 2019 University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Technology. All rights reserved.",

Instead, nanoparticles disperse into the mixture between upper and subphase solvents. By contrast, the low miscibility and high surface tension gradient between deionized water subphase and hexane lead to a long-range ordered monolayer. Interestingly, domains of hexagonal close-packed superlattices and honeycomb pattern are also obtained.

However, the formation of MnO is practically unavoidable during these steps since both Mn and MnBi are easily oxidized even by trace amounts of oxygen. In this work, an oxygen-free pressing-annealing system is developed to facilitate the synthesis of LTP MnBi with minimal oxidization. The semi-automatic pressing is carried out by using the compression piston and the load cell is used to measure the pressing force. The copper plate and cylindrical container are heated by nichrome filament heating. Mn and Bi precursors in powder form are simultaneously pressed and annealed allowing one step formation of LTP MnBi in argon atmosphere chamber.

The obtained magnetic properties are related to the MnBi peaks in XRD patterns as well as the Mn-edge XANES spectra. Although the spectra in the case of Mn:Bi ratio of 2:1 and 3:1 resemble that of MnO reference, the pre-edge is shifted by the contribution of zero valent Mn and the peak intensity is reduced.

  "abstract": "The potential applications in hydrogen storage and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices have led to investigation of cobalt-silicon (Co-Si) alloys. By ball-milling amount fractions of 40 % cobalt (Co) and 60 % silicon (Si) powders for 1-3 h, crystalline fcc and hcp Co as well as fcc Si phases were detected without impurity phase. All three samples exhibited ferromagnetism with increasing magnetizations with increasing milling time due to the reduction in magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The 0.4% decrease in an electrical resistance of the pressed 3 h-milled powders under an 11 kOe-magnetic field was attributed to the GMR effect. Since the GMR mainly arises from the spin-dependent scattering across magnetic Co/semiconducting Si interfaces, the room temperature GMR ratio was reduced with increasing grain sizes in the case of 2 and 1 h. From these results, this functional material is attractive for its combination of electromagnetic with electrochemical properties. © 2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.",

In this work, the effect of liquid and solid substrates on the nanoparticle assembly was compared. Iron (III) dibenzoylmethane (Fe(dbm)                             3                             ) was used as an alternative reagent to highly toxic iron pentacabonyl (Fe(CO)                             5                             ) in the co-reduction with platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)                             2                             ). The as-synthesized iron-platinum (FePt) based nanoparticles were dropped either on diethelyne glycol (DEG) or directly on carbon-coated copper grid. In the case of DEG, the drastic movement of nanoparticles during the liquid-air interface assembly tracked by a camera terminated after 15 seconds. A subsequent inspection after transferring the monolayers from DEG to carbon-coated copper grid grid substrates confirmed the extended area of ordered nanoparticles from the liquid-air interface assembly. These results demonstrated that the liquid-air interface method is effective not only in patterning monodisperse nanoparticles but also those with wider size distributions.                          © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Their antifungal property was tested on mulberry papers made from the woody stem of tube sedge (Lepironia articurata). The papers coated by 2-12 mg/mL of ZnO dispersion exhibited a resistance to Aspergillus Niger when subjected to the fungus for up to 15 days. The inhibition was attributed to the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO microclusters, which is not sensitive to the calcination temperature from 600 to 800 °C. This finding is beneficial for the manufacture of antifungal handicraft products from mulberry papers and of local bulrush basketry from tube sedge. © 2018 Editura Academiei Romane.

  "abstract": "Magnetic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution are desirable for applications in ultra-high density data storage and biomedicine. In this work, the size-selective precipitation and aggregate reduction were combined to classify superparamagnetic iron platinum- (FePt-) based nanoparticles. The size-selective precipitation was implemented with the variation in the amount of ethanol. In the first condition, the ratio of ethanol-to-nanosuspension of 3: 4 was used in the precipitation twice. By contrast, the second condition employed the ratios of ethanol-to-nanosuspension of 4: 4 in the first precipitation and 5: 4 in the second precipitation. The first precipitation successfully sorted out the aggregated particles, and the second precipitation collected particles with a narrow size distribution. The increase in ethanol enhanced the monodispersity of nanoparticles as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and size distribution curves. In addition, large aggregated by-products from the precipitation stage were sonicated with the addition of surfactants. The increase in ultrasonic power reduces the aggregation, but the longer sonication led to an uneven distribution. © 2018 Pharunee Sarmphim et al.",

  "abstract": "The combination of energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) and synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) provides the detailed composition of fine-paste ware (FPW) kendis, dated back to 13th–14th century maritime Southeast Asia. Sources of clay and production sites were classified according to Al2O3, SiO2, α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 as well as trace elements. The similarities based on these components provided another evidence of a trade route between Kota Cina in North Sumatra of Indonesia and Kok Moh on Satingphra Peninsula, a well-known production area in present-day Thailand. In additions, the uniquely large contribution of α-Fe2O3 in XANES spectra suggests that Nakhon Si Thammarat province of Thailand could also be one of FPW production areas in maritime Southeast Asia.

Compared with conventional chemical syntheses, this simple approach is relatively safe and allows control over the alloy morphology and magnetic behavior as a function of the alloy composition with minimal oxidation. For alloys having low (10%–30%) Fe content the single face-centered cubic (FCC) FeNi3 phase was formed with nanorods aligned in the (1 1 1) crystalline direction on the cluster surface. This highly anisotropic morphology gradually disappeared as the Fe content was raised to 40%–70% with the alloy structure possessing a mixture of FCC FeNi3 and body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe7Ni3. The FCC phase was entirely replaced by the BCC structure upon further increase the Fe content to 80%–90%. The substitution of Ni by Fe in the crystals and the dominance of the BCC phase over the FCC structure gave rise to enhanced magnetization. By contrast, the coercive field decreased as a function of increasing Fe because of the reduction in shape anisotropy and the rise of saturation magnetization. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

The hematite phase was shown to be absent from our X-ray diffraction results, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed a preference for the maghemite phase over magnetite. Our results showed that maghemite nanoparticles formed with larger crystallite sizes and lower structural distortion when higher reagent concentrations and longer sonication/reaction times were used.

In this study, as-synthesized nanosuspensions from the reaction of Pt(acac)2 with Fe(acac)3 and Fe(hfac)3 are compared. X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks for both samples are assigned to the FePt3 phase. As shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nanoparticles synthesized by using Fe(acac)3 have a smaller average diameter, but larger polydispersity index and particle agglomerations. On the other hand, the nanoparticles synthesized by using Fe(hfac)3 can self-assemble into a longer range of patterned monolayer. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), measuring the size of cluster of nanoparticles as well as oleic acid and oleylamine at their surface, confirms that larger agglomerations in the sample were synthesized by using Fe(acac)3. In addition to the size distribution, magnetic properties were influenced by the composition of these nanoparticles.",

  "abstract": "The variation in morphology of zinc oxide (ZnO) with the pH of 0.05 M Zn(NO3)2 and 1.00 M NaOH aqueous solutions is demonstrated. Microstructured ZnO ranges from cuboid to spindle as the pH is reduced from 12 to 9. The ratio of visible-to-UV peak from photoluminescence spectra is also decreased, whereas the energy gap calculated from UV-Vis spectra remains comparable. Furthermore, nanospheroids and microellipsoid are, respectively, obtained when the molar concentration of NaOH is reduced to 0.20 and 0.10 M for the synthesis with the pH of 7. Due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, these ZnO nanospheroids exhibit a higher antibacterial activity than that of commercial ZnO in the disc diffusion method. According to this method as well as the minimal inhibitory concentration measurement, the effectiveness is substantial in the case of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. By contrast, the inhibitions of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginasa are barely observed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

  "abstract": "Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous bioactive SiO2-CaO-Na2O-P2O5 glass (3DOM-BG) is synthesized by using the sol-gel method. After an in vitro test in simulated body fluid (SBF), the hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystalline phase is clearly formed on its surface as confirmed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Magnetic 3DOM-BG/Fe samples are synthesized by partial substitution of SiO2 with iron oxide. Whilst the HAp layer is not confirmed, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and XRD analysis reveal calcium phosphate layer on the surface of 3DOM-BG/Fe samples after the SBF soaking. The growth of HAp-like layer is slower with increasing iron oxides. The initial mechanism that thought to induce bone formation is reduced due to the replacement of Ca2 + with Fe ions in the glass network. The formation of HAp-like layer is modified by the sedimentation of Ca and P while the nonmagnetic 3DOM-BG forms the calcium phosphate by the ionic exchange following the Hench mechanism. The adult human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hADSCs) can be closely attached and well spread on the flat-plate of all 3DOM-BG/Fe and 3DOM-BG. Without detectable cytotoxicity possibly induced by iron oxides, the osteoblast can be grown and proliferated. In addition to these bioactivity and biocompatibility, porous structures can allow their possible use in targeted drug delivery and magnetic properties of 3DOM-BG/Fe can essentially be implemented in hyperthermia therapy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",

By virtue of surface modification, hexagonal ZnO microprisms can be uniformly dispersed in PU matrix even at a loading as high as 25 wt%. However, the disruption of ZnO fillers can be observed with the suppression of characteristic PU absorption bands in Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and the enthalpy reduction in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms. The morphological effect is highlighted by the significant changes in DSC and FT-IR spectra when hexagonal ZnO is substituted with the sword-like counterpart.

  "abstract": "The self-assembly of nanoparticles is a prominent strategy for fabricating nanomaterials and nanodevices. Herein, FePt-based nanoparticles are self-assembled at a diethylene glycol–air interface, under an applied in-plane static magnetic field. The effect of the field on the self-assembly is apparent at a field strength of 60 mT, whereby nanoparticles arranged into randomly oriented nanoparticle chains. Increasing the field strength to 90–120 mT resulted in the nanoparticle chains becoming increasingly disintegrated, and large islands form at the expense of the uniform nanoparticle monolayer. The pattern arising from self-assembly is described based on the drag force and ligand–ligand interactions, which compete with van der Waals forces and magnetic dipole interactions induced by the applied magnetic field. © 2016, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science.",

  "abstract": "This article reviews the advances in additive manufacturing of magnetic ceramics and alloys without rare-earth elements. Near-net-shaped permanent magnets with varying shapes and dimensions overcome traditional limitations of the cast, sintered, and bonded magnets. The published articles are categorized based on material types and 3D printing techniques. Selective laser melting and electron beam melting were predominantly used to produce alnico magnets. In addition to the electron beam melting, manganese aluminium-based alloys were successfully printed by fuse filament fabrication. By incorporating magnetic powders in polymers and then printing via extrusion, the fuse filament fabrication was also used to produce strontium ferrite magnets. Moreover, hard ferrites were printed by stereolithography and extrusion free-forming, without drawing composites into filaments. Magnetic properties in some cases are comparable to those of conventional magnets with the same compositions. Currently, available software packages can simulate magnetic fields for designing magnets and optimize the integration in electrical machines. These developments open up opportunities for next-generation permanent magnet applications. © 2022 by the authors.",

The subsequent annealing at 340°C gave rise to higher magnetizations and coercivity compared to using 410°C as an annealing temperature.

Three different magnetic properties are obtained depending on the synthesis composition and calcination atmosphere. The gradual transition from paramagnetism to superparamagnetism is observed when ferric nitrate is increased from 5 up to 20mol%. In contrast to minimal paramagnetic response to an applied magnetic field, substantial magnetizations are induced in superparamagneticMMBGowing to the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles, which is signified by the change in color after calcination. The transition from superparamagnetism to ferromagnetism occurs when the MMBG are calcined in an argon instead of an oxygen atmosphere. This ferromagnetic hysteresis coincides with the formation of Fe-rich spheres with diameters larger than 100 nm. © 2016 Göller Verlag.",

  "abstract": "FePt nanoparticle is under development as ultrahigh density recording material because it retains ferromagnetic properties even if its dimension is reduced below 10 nm. However, the heat treatment, required to transform the superparamagnetism of as-synthesized particle into ferromagnetic phase, brings about undesirable increases in particle size. This work demonstrates that the magnetic phase transition without excessive agglomeration can be obtained by annealing long-range monolayer assembly of FePt based nanoparticles. The magnetic properties are dependent on the type of Fe(β-diketonate)3 used in the synthesis due to the variations in elemental compositions and mixed phases in annealed nanoparticles. Whereas X-ray characterizations confirm the conversion of FePt3/Fe2O3 into FePt by annealing, characteristics of hysteresis also suggest the co-existence of other minor phases. When either Fe(tmhd)3 or Fe(hfac)3 is employed as starting materials, the Fe fraction is much less than that of Pt resulting in narrow hysteresis loop with low coercivity. By contrast, the coercivity is enhanced with the Fe:Pt ratio closer to the unity in the case of Fe(acac)3 and Fe(dbm)3. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",

The scattering vector at which this peak occurs (qpeak) varies with the concentration of FePt3 colloidal suspension used in the liquid-air interface assembly. When the concentration is increased from 0.2 to 0.4 mg/ml, the qpeak is decreased signifying the increase in particle spacing.

  "abstract": "The liquid–air interface is demonstrated as a method to assemble nanoparticles synthesized from the reaction between iron (III) dibenzoylmethane (Fe(dbm)3) and platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) into a long range monolayer. These surface-modified particles have average Fe to Pt atomic ratio of 0.77:1. The increase in surfactants further reduces the Fe:Pt ratio and increases the particle diameter to over 4 nm. The self-assembled pattern of FePt-based nanoparticles can be enhanced by dropping nanoparticle suspensions on the surface of diethelyne glycol (DEG). The concentrations of these nanoparticle suspensions in hexane from 0.2 to 0.4 mg/ml can be used without the agglomeration into multilayered islands. The voids in the self-assembled monolayer on the DEG-air interface are reduced to the minimum in the case of the lowest concentration. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

  "abstract": "Publications from Walailak University in ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS and Thai-Journal Citation Index (TCI) databases are analyzed. From 2007 to 2014, the number of publication in the ISI database has increased from about 20 to almost 70 research articles reaching the maximum publications in both ISI and TCI databases in 2013. With the total of 489 articles found on SCOPUS, the highest number of publication per staff over 0.25 is also obtained in 2013. The largest contribution in each year belongs to School of science whereas School of allied health science and public health and School of medicine have impressive growths of international publication in recent years. The majority of the published articles are from research collaborations and international collaborations approximately accounted for one third of all international publications. Since the publications have vastly accumulated, the number of citations in the ISI database has substantially raised from 106 times in 2008 to 502 times in 2014. © 2015, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "By implementing transmission electron microscope (TEM) image processing, effects of a reducing agent and surfactant concentrations on the reactions between Pt(acac) 2 and alternative Fe(β-diketonate) 3, i.e., Fe(tmhd) 3 and Fe(hfac) 3, can be determined. The oleic acid and oleylamine of 0.5 mmol give rise to the FePt-based nanoparticles as small as 3 nm. Larger particles up to 5 nm in diameter with better self-assembled patterns are obtained by increasing each surfactant to 5 mmol. With such excessive surfactants in the synthesis, the reducing agent such as 1,2-hexadecanediol may not be required since it does not significantly influence the particle size and assembly. Moreover, it accelerates the reduction of Pt(acac) 2, resulting in larger size distribution. This work demonstrates that image processing allows the size analysis from statistically sufficient number of nanoparticles. This intensity-based analysis is, however, susceptible to the error arising from a low contrast between the nanoparticle and the background. The magnification of TEM images should therefore be optimized to minimize systematic errors. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

The tensile properties deteriorated in the case of NR whereas the storage modulus was reduced for PU composites. The CoFe2 O4 inhibited the crosslinking and orientations to form crystallites in NR and reduced the stiffness of PU due to poor adsorption between the matrix and fillers.

  "abstract": "Iron oxides in macro/mesoporous bioactive glasses were characterized by synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. This magnetic phase was introduced by adding Fe(NO3)3 9H2O during the sol-gel synthesis. The obtained bioactive glass scaffolds exhibited superparamagnetism, in which the magnetization was increased with the increase in the Fe molar ratio from 10 to 20%. The linear combination fits of the XANES spectra indicated that the increase in the Fe molar ratio to 20% enhanced the γ-Fe2O3 formation at the expense of the α-Fe2O3 phase. This variation also promoted the formation of fine-grained bone-like apatites on the surface of the scaffolds in the in vitro test. The apatite growth between three and seven days was confirmed by the changing elemental compositions. However, the highest magnetic proportion led to the distortion of the skeleton walls and the collapse of the porous networks. © 2015 Author(s). Licensee InTech.",

After 2-8 h of ball-milling, the characteristic XRD peaks of the face-centered-cubic (fcc) Si and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Co phases remained sharp without a cobalt-silicide phase. As the milling progressed, the particle size observed by SEM tended to reduce, being accompanied by smoother edges and a narrow size distribution. On the DTA curves, between 200 °C and 1200 °C, exothermic peaks indicated a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition, whereas endothermic peaks corresponded to the lattice recovery, the transition from a hcp to a fcc Co and melting. The longest milling of up to 8 h significantly increased the magnetic squareness and the coercive field.",

The self-assembly of nanoparticles into regular arrays is complicated since the precise control of interactions between particles is required. The development of methods that can rapidly assess dispersed nanoparticle populations is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a multi-level segmentation procedure for measuring the size distribution and dispersion index of spheroidal nanoparticles from transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of nanoparticles. We focus on the inspection of individual particles in the case of non-overlapping samples, as well as, when particles agglomerate in overlapping samples.

  "abstract": "A liquid-air interfacial assembly approach is a technique to fabricate long-range well-ordered nanostructures in either two or three dimensions. In this work, magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized by co-reduction of iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) and platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) in benzyl ether. A few drops of the as-made nanoparticle suspension with varying concentrations were spread on the surface of diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and deionized water. After solvent evaporation, a substrate was placed under the liquid surface and then gently lifted up to collect nanoparticle layers. Although the nanoparticles are irregular in shape, they could well self-assemble on the diethylene glycol surface, forming an extended monolayer with small defects. By contrast, multilayer domains were frequently obtained when deionized water and ethylene glycol were used as the liquid subphases. An appropriate nanoparticle concentration was also a crucial factor in this approach. The lower concentration could not form an extended monolayer while the higher concentration led to multilayer assemblies. The order of the nanoparticle layers also strongly depended on the uniformity of the nanoparticles. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra could be fitted with the contributions from hematite (α-Fe2O3) and, to a lesser extent, metallic Fe. The increase in reagent concentrations increased the Fe fraction which partly explained the change in magnetization of superparamagnetic particles. Nevertheless, the α-Fe2O3 composition was increased by using a longer reaction time. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

  "abstract": "Arrays of 11.2-16.6 μm holes were patterned on 50 μm thick SU-8 photoresist layers by using synchrotron X-ray lithography. After the resist development, the chemically stable and mechanically hardened SU-8 templates with varying hole sizes were used as substrates for RF sputtering of 1.5 μm-thick cobalt (Co). By comparing hysteresis loops from in-plane and out-of-plane magnetisation, the Co film on patterned substrate with average hole size of 16.6 μm was more isotropic than in the case of 15.3 and 11.2 μm. Both magnetic squareness and coercive field were at the minimum when the holes were smallest. After the removal of Co on SU-8 surfaces, the remaining Co deposits in the holes exhibited smaller squareness and anisotropy. On the other hand, the enhanced coercive field was increased with a reduction in diameter of patterned holes. © 2014 Inst Materials Physics. All rights reserved.",

The obtained superparamagnetic nanoparticles are 4-5 nm in diameter without showing a large size variation with substituent Fe(β-diketonate)3. The synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the energy dispersive spectroscopy that as-synthesized nanoparticles were composed of iron oxides and metallic FePt3 alloys. By employing Fe(hfac)3, the Fe fraction was reduced and the magnetization was modest. The use of Fe(dbm) 3 as starting materials gave rise to densely packed FePt 3/Fe2O3 heterodimers. The replacements of Fe(acac)3 by Fe(tmhd)3 led to the long-range order of nanoparticle assembly with the narrowest size distribution. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.",

  "abstract": "Three dimensionally ordered macroporous bioactive glasses (3DOM-BGs), namely 80SiO2-15CaO-5P2O5, were synthesized by sol-gel method. PMMA colloidal crystals and non-ionic block copolymers P123 were used as cotemplates. The amorphous 3DOM-BGs had skeletal walls enclosing macropores. Such structure resulted from octahedral and tetrahedral holes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) closest packed PMMA templates and windows interconnecting through macropores network. The thicknesses of the walls were around 50 nm-80 nm and the windows were 90 nm-110 nm in diameter. These wall thickness is increased by with an increase in ageing time up to 24 h and then gradually reduced with further increase in aging time. Vibration bands of Si-O-Si and P-O were evident in infrared spectra which are in agreement with EDS spectra indicating Si, P and Ca compositions. After in vitro bioactivity testing by soaking 3DOM-BGs in simulated body fluid at 37 °C, the crystallization of amorphous calcium phosphate layers compatible to the bone component of hydroxyl carbonate apatite were rapidly formed within 3 h. These results indicated that these 3DOM-BGs resembled ideal bone implant materials.",

  "abstract": "The sonochemical reaction between varying concentrations of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) in a 150 W dual transducer sonicator resulted in different phases of zinc compounds. Single phase zinc oxide (ZnO) was exclusively obtained in the case of 0.05 M. By tracking the products synthesized at 50 C, zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH)2) was formed in the first 40 min and replaced by ZnO after prolonged sonication. Zn(OH)2 was also present in a mixed phase with ZnO when the reagent concentration was reduced to 0.01 M. The increase in the synthesis temperature up to 80 C reduced defects and free radicals but introduced zinc hydroxide nitrate hydrate (Zn5(OH)8(NO3) 2(H2O)2) which is a dominant phase from the reaction between highly concentrated reagents (0.1 M). High temperature and sonication power in this system tend to cause agglomerations into irregular microparticles. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

The crystallite size of the rhombohedral manganites was increased and the magnetisation was decreased with increasing Gd doping from x = 0-0.3. By using the indirect measurement, the entropy change computed from temperaturedependent magnetisation was proportional to the applied DC magnetic field. Under the field of 0.7 T, the maximum entropy changes of 0.93-1.14 J/kg·K were observed around the Curie temperature (TC) determined by AC magnetic susceptometry. The TC was decreased with the increase in x. The maximum magnetocaloric effect occured in the sample with x = 0.15 and it could be used in magnetic refrigeration near the room temperature.",

This single phase was formed by low power sonication for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath at ambient conditions and its morphology did not change for the next 60 min.

The Otsu's thresholding converted grayscale to binary images and the closing morphology algorithm was applied to reduce noise in the images. The Canny edge detector was used to identify the contour of each pore by detecting abrupt intensity changes in the binary image. Pores were detected and their sizes were subsequently evaluated.

Their magnetic squareness and coercive field were slightly reduced with the increase in the annealing at 800 °C from 2 h to 6 h. To examine the reproducibility of ferrite products of the PVA sol-gel method, the synthetic condition was repeated 28 times. After annealing for 4 h, CoFe2O4 samples from different batches exhibit variations in the magnetic properties. The coercive field has a large distribution because of its sensitivity to the particle agglomeration, whereas the squareness fluctuates in a narrower range from 0.22 to 0.29. Since the squareness is the ratio of the remanence to the saturation magnetization, the particle agglomeration tends to increase both values while keeping this ratio rather unchanged.",

  "abstract": "The synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that magnetic nanoparticles synthesized from the reaction between Fe(acac)3 and Pt(acac)2 in the modified polyol process were composed of iron oxides and Pt metallic phases. By virtue of thermal treatment at 650 °C for 1 hour, this iron oxide phase was reduced to Fe metallic phase shown by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. Interestingly, the difference between annealed nanoparticles in the case of 3.5 and 4.5 mmol surfactants was observed exclusively from the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. The reduction of iron oxide was evidently facilitated by the products decomposed from the surfactants during the thermal annealing. The fraction of oxygen in the elemental composition was therefore reduced. The annealing also transformed magnetic nanoparticles around 5 nm in diameter into ferromagnetic aggregates with the size over 30 nm.

  "abstract": "Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) powders synthesised by sol-gel techniques were incorporated into natural rubber (NR) and polyurethane (PU) by two-roll milling at different loadings from 0 to 45 phr. In either NR or PU composites, the magnetisations were proportional to the CoFe 2O4 loading, but the coercive field remained rather insensitive to the loading. The frequency response from 1 MHz to 1 GHz revealed that the real part of the magnetic permeability increased significantly only in the case of 45 phr CoFe2O4, while the imaginary part was modest in both NR and PU composites. In contrast, the electrical permittivity of CoFe2O4-PU was larger than that of CoFe2O 4-NR composites, and both parts at 100 MHz had linear variations with the loading, in agreement with Wagner's equation. © Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining 2013.",

  "abstract": "The segmentation between rigid and rubbery chains in polyurethanes (PUs) influences polymeric properties and implementations. Several models have successfully been proposed to visualize the configuration between the hard segment (HS) and soft segment (SS). For particulate PU composites, the arrangement of HS and SS is more complicated because the fillers tend to disrupt the chain formation and segmentation. In this work, the effect of ferromagnetic cobalt (Co) powders (average diameter 2 m) on PU synthesized from a reaction between polyether polyol (soft segment) and diphenylmethane-4,4′- diisocyanate (hard segment) was studied with varying loadings (0, 20, 40, and 60 wt.%). The 300 m thick PU/Co samples were tape-casted and then received heat treatment at 80°C for 180 min. From synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), the plot of the X-ray scattering intensity (I) against the scattering vector (q) exhibited a typical single peak of PU whose intensity was reduced by the increase in the Co loading. Characteristic SAXS peaks in the case of 0-20 wt.% Co agreed well with the scattering by globular hard segment domains according to Zernike-Prins and Percus-Yevick models. The higher Co loadings led to larger deviations from all theoretical models. © 2013 Krit Koyvanich et al.",

For the falling in air experiment, the displacement of a ball was proportional to the time squared and the agreement with the theory was indicated by the derivation of the acceleration due to the gravity with an acceptable level of accuracy. In additions, the effects of the height of falling, the camera distance as well as the color of ball and background were investigated.

  "abstract": "Magnetic fluid is a special class of materials which possesses the advantages of a liquid state of the carrier and a magnetic state of the particles. In addition to the conventional uses in mechanical engineering, magnetic fluids containing magnetite (Fe3O4) superparamagnetic nanoparticles are under research and development for drug delivery, hyperthermia and MRI contrast agents. On the other hand, iron-platinum (FePt) is investigated as materials for ultrahigh density recording. Before their assembly into patterned media, the as-synthesized FePt nanoparticles in superparamagnetic state are commonly stored in forms of magnetic fluids. In this work, iron-platinum (FePt) nanoparticles with their surface modified by oleic acid and oleyleamine were synthesized from the polyol process. The starting material was an environmental friendly iron(III) acetylacetonate and the products were dispersed in N-hexane. In small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements at the Synchrotron Light Research Institute, Thailand, each magnetic fluid was injected into a sample cell with aluminum foil windows and the X-ray of wavelength 1.55 Å from BL2.2 was used. The measured SAXS intensity profiles as a function of the scattering vector from 0.27 to 2.30 nm-1 were fitted and compared between two different reactions. Nanoparticles synthesized by using a higher amount of Fe(acac)3 were matched with monodisperse spheres of radius 2.4±0.3 nm. The other reaction with a reducing agent gave rise to smaller nanoparticles of two size distributions. From this work, the potential of synchrotron radiation to complement conventional characterization techniques in the investigation of nanoparticles for high density recording and biomedical applications is underlined. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications.",

With increasing SmCo5 content, the particulate composites exhibited an increase in the remanent magnetization when the coercive field remained rather constant. The electrical impedance of each composite did not show a large variation between 10 kHz and 100 kHz but rapidly rose with the increase in frequency from around 200 kHz to 1 MHz due to the skin effect. All impedance spectra were slightly shifted when the magnetic field of 3.3 kA/m was applied. The largest difference was observed in the case of Co30Ag70 without SmCo5 addition. The results confirmed the relationship between the magnetic softness of materials and their electrical impedance in magnetic field.

With the increase in Hac from 5 to 20 Oe, the magnitude of ME susceptibility (the ratio of induced electric polarization to Hac) is decreased indicating an insensitive polarization to the variation of Hac in this regime. When the frequency of Hac is lower than 2.5 kHz, the ME susceptibility is increased with increasing bias magnetic field (Hdc) up to 280 Oe. With further increases in Hdc, the ME susceptibility drops to a saturation value. By contrast, the ME susceptibility in the case of Hac beyond 2.5 kHz is monotonically increased by the increase in Hdc up to 4500 Oe. At 2.5 kHz, the ME effect has a linear variation with the Hdc ranging from 800 Oe to 4500 Oe.",

X-ray diffraction studies indicated single phase CoFe2O4 with larger crystallite size and with the hysteresis loops displaying an increase in both coercive field and squareness as the PVA content was increased. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that desorption of water and combustion of excess gel were clearly observed in CoFe2O4 prepared from 10 % and 15 % PVA in water. In the case of 5 % PVA in water, two other ratios of cobalt nitrate: iron nitrate: PVA solution were also tested and it was found that the 1:2:10 ratio led to the smallest coercive field and squareness. © 2012 Wroclaw University of Technology.",

  "abstract": "Magnetic properties of composites prepared by coating lacquer containing neodymium iron boron (Nd-Fe-B) powders on rubberwood were characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), magnetic moment measurements, and attraction tests with an iron-core solenoid. The Nd-Fe-B powders were recycled from electronic wastes by the ball-milling technique. Varying the milling time from 20 to 300 min, the magnetic squareness and the coercive field of the Nd-Fe-B powders were at the minimum when the powders were milled for 130 min. It followed that the coercive field of the magnetic wood composites was increased with the milling time increasing from 130 to 300 min. For the magnetic wood composites using Nd-Fe-B obtained from the same milling time, the magnetic squareness and the coercive field were rather insensitive to the variation of Nd-Fe-B concentration in coating lacquer from 0.43 to 1.00 g/cm3. By contrast, the magnetization and magnetic moment were increased with the Nd-Fe-B concentration increasing. Furthermore, the electrical current in the solenoid required for the attraction of the magnetic wood composites was exponentially reduced with the increase in the amount of Nd-Fe-B used in the coating. © 2013 University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

  "abstract": "Five different conditions for modified polyol processes using iron(III) acetylacetonate and platinum(II) acetylacetonate as starting materials reveal significantly different products in terms of composition. The initial Fe:Pt molar ratio is not retained in the final products and Pt-rich nanoparticles are obtained from 1:1 molar ratio of Fe:Pt sources. The imbalance between Fe and Pt indicate that the nanoparticles formation can be explained by the heterocoagulation mechanism rather than the binary nucleation model. The increase in refluxing time and initial Fe:Pt molar ratio improved the amount of Fe in nanoparticles. However, the highest molar ratio of 3:1 apparently affected the uniformity of particles. The co-existence of iron oxide and Pt-rich nanoparticles is clearly evident in the case of 3:1 molar ratio combined with 1,2 hexadecanediol as a reducing agent.",

  "abstract": "The growth of Walailak Journal of Science and Technology is chronicled through a scientometric analysis from 2010 to 2015. The number of submissions has vastly increased since the online submission system was introduced in 2011 and surpassed 400 manuscripts per year in 2014 - 2015. It follows that the acceptance ratio has been reduced to the minimum of 25 % in 2015. The 339 published papers, mostly full-length research articles, are categorized into Science (46.61 %), Agricultural technology (23.30 %), Engineering (17.70 %), Health sciences (6.78 %) and Information technology (4.72 %). The journal is benefited from demographic diversity of authors. Papers submitted from 27 different countries were published during this 6-year period. Furthermore, domestic reviewers and editorial board members have become the minority since 2012. The citation recorded in SCOPUS database has continued to improve with the reduction in self-citation ratio. The lastest Scimago Journal Rank (SJR) obtained in 2014 is 0.207 with 33 citations and average 0.33 citations per paper. © 2016, Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "The ultrasonic reaction of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO 3)2·6H2O) and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) was investigated by varying the concentration of the reactants, the irradiation time, and the type of sonicator. The morphology, composition, and phase structure of the products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and ultravioletvisible (UVvis) spectroscopy. Octahedral zinc oxide (ZnO) micropowders were formed at low concentrations, 0.05 M, of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and C 6H12N4 in both lab-made sonicator and commercial ultrasonic bath. However, at concentrations between 0.1 and 1.0 M Zn(NO3)2C6H12N4 mainly plate-like zinc hydroxide nitrate hydrate (Zn5(OH) 8(NO3)2(H2O)2) resulted with only a small fraction of ZnO, irrespective of the irradiation time employed, highlighting the sensitivity of the system to the concentration of the starting materials. Heat treatment of Zn5(OH)8(NO 3)2(H2O)2 at 350 °C in air affords a ZnO phase of irregular morphology. Octahedral ZnO is found to exhibit slightly lower IR absorption and similar UV absorption to that of commercial prismatic hexagonal ZnO, although an extra peak due to small quantities of Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2(H2O) 2 is observed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, cobalt deposition broadens the frequency-dependent MI curves, and the frequency range with a large MI ratio is extended.

  "abstract": "The synchrotron X-ray absorption technique was used to complement electron microscopy in the investigation of nanoparticles synthesized from the coreduction of iron acetylacetonate, Fe(acac)3 and platinum acetylacetonate, Pt(acac)2. A much higher Pt composition than Fe leads to an extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum for the sample that differs from that of fcc FePt nanoparticles. Most importantly, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra clearly indicate the existence of α-Fe2O3 and Pt metal. Since these monodisperse nanoparticles have a diameter of around 4nm and tend to self-assemble into hexagonal arrangements, they can be modeled as Pt-rich cores with an α-Fe2O3 shell stabilized by organic surfactants. © 2012 K.

  "abstract": "Magnetic separation combined with adsorption by activated carbon has been found to be a useful method for removing pollutants. In this paper, the use of palm shell as a source of activated carbon for the removal and recovery of oil from palm oil mill effluent (POME) is studied. In the first part of the study, the properties of samples of activated carbon prepared from palm shell under a variety of different conditions were characterized for their hydrophobicity, surface areas and pore size distribution. The most effective of the activated carbon samples was prepared by impregnation with ZnCl2 followed by combined physical/chemical activation under carbon dioxide flow at 800 °C. Four grams of these samples adsorbed 90% of the oil from 50 mL POME. In the second part, the palm shell-based carbon samples were given magnetic properties by the technique of iron oxide deposition. Ninety-four percent of the activated carbon/iron oxide composite containing the adsorbed oil could be extracted from the POME by a magnetic bar of 0.15 T. Four grams of the composite can remove 85% of oil from 50 mL POME and a total of 67% of the initial oil can then be recovered by hexane extraction. Powder X-ray diffractometry showed the presence of magnetite and maghemite in the activated carbon/iron oxide composite. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Physical properties of polyurethane (PU) can be modified for desired applications by adding appropriate fillers. In this work, cobalt (Co) powder of average diameter 2 μm was filled in PU elastomers synthesized by a reaction between polyol and diisocyanate. Variation of Co loading (0, 20,40 and 60 wt.%) modified thermal properties of PU composites in terms of the shift in a melting temperature and the increase in heat absorption. From DC hysteresis loops, PU/Co composites exhibited ferromagnetic properties with improved magnetizations by the increase in Co loading. On the other hand, the coercive field was almost unvaried. For high frequency electromagnetic behaviors, the complex electrical permittivity (ε′-jε″') and magnetic permeability (μ′-jμ″) were sensitive to the frequency from 10 MHz up to 100 MHz and reached the modest values in the regime between 100 MHz and 1 GHz. At each frequency, the real part of permeability and permittivity of PU were raised by the inclusion of Co fillers. While the thermal behaviors were explained using the interaction between Co clusters and the PU matrix, the electromagnetic properties can be understood by taking into the account of interactions between Co clusters at high loading levels. © Freund Publishing House Ltd.",

PVA of 24, 32, 40 and 48 g in 10% w/v aqueous solutions was used in the reaction between 10.592 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 29.407 g of Fe(NO 3)3·9H2O. The decrease in PVA led to the reductions in coercive field and squareness. However, X-ray diffraction peaks indicated that iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) and iron oxide hydroxide [FeO(OH)] were also formed when the PVA was less than 48 g. The optimized amount for obtaining single phase CoFe2O4 was therefore 48 g which was used for studies of heat treatment effect. Both coercive field and squareness were increased with the increase in annealing temperature from 280 to 680°C and then reduced with the further increasing temperature up to 900°C as a result of particles agglomeration. © 2011 The Ceramic Society of Japan.",

  "abstract": "Monolayered Co and trilayered Co/Cu/Co were electroplated on 485 μm-diameter Cu wires using the bath pH 2.5.These wires can be functioned as magnetic sensors owing to their magnetoimpedance (Ml) effect. By measuring at four different frequencies (100, 250, 500, and 1000 kHz) and Co thicknesses (2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 25.0 μm), the Ml ratio of electroplated Co on Cu wires tended to increase with increasing Co thickness and frequency of the driving current. The Co/Cu/Co on Cu wires exhibited even higher Ml ratio. The magnetic layer also regulated the magnetic inductions and anisotropy regardless of the size of nonmagnetic core. Nevertheless, the diameter of the Cu core had a significant effect on the Ml ratio. By comparing with the 47.7 μm-diameter Ag cores electroplated by Co and Co/Cu/Co of the same thickness, the Cu cores with a larger diameter gave rise to a larger Ml ratio because their lower electrical resistance enhanced the crossing effect. Substantial Ml ratio was observed even in a low frequency regime because the skin effect occurred at a low frequency in the case of electroplated wires with large core diameters. © 2009 by the Editorial Board of Journal of Materials Science and Technology, Shenyang, China.

Both milling and annealing bring about oxidation of the samples. The powders show exothermic behaviors corresponding to the lattice-recovery process. Different milling times and annealing temperatures give rise to different exothermic peaks because of oxidation and the cluster distribution. At room temperature, the compressed powders show, on average, up to 11% giant magnetoresistance (GMR) under 10 kOe with sharp switching. The results may be understood in terms of spin-dependent scattering across Co/oxide/Cu interfaces. Annealing reduces the resistance but does not promote the GMR.

By annealing at 800°C, the GMI sensitivity rises from 1.29%/Oe to 1.91%/Oe and the ratio increases from 237% to 294% with decreasing characteristic frequency. The results are attributable to an increase in the transverse magnetic permeability during the heat treatment. From simulation by finite element method, the GMI effect can be interpreted as the modification of the current distribution by the applied magnetic field via the transverse permeability.

  "abstract": "Sensors based on the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect in silicon steels were constructed. Strips of silicon steels (0.500 mm-thick, 35.0 mm-long) with widths ranging from 0.122 to 1.064 mm were cut from recycled transformer cores. Since a maximum GMI ratio of 300% and a maximum field sensitivity of 1.5%/Oe were observed in a 1.064 mm-wide sample at 200 kHz, the 1.064 mm-wide strips were chosen as sensing elements in a slot key switch, angular velocity sensor, current sensor and force sensor. The sensing elements were integrated into electronic circuits and the changes in impedance were monitored. Variations in voltage due to these changes were typically small and must therefore be amplified by the electronic circuits. For the current sensor and force sensor, the variation in the voltage drop across the GMI sensing element had non-linear variations with either current or force and a conversion formula from a computer program was therefore needed. The performance of the systems was tested. These sensing systems were stable, highly sensitive, hysteresis-free and could be produced on a mass scale. Based on their GMI effect, the silicon steels are versatile alternative low-cost sensors. © 2008 by MDPI.",

Their mechanical and cure properties were studied as a function of NdFeB loading from 0-120 phr. With increasing magnetic loading, the cure time of the NdFeB-NR composites were exponentially decreased because of the reduction of the polymer chain crosslink. The tensile strength of the NR compound, related to the cure characteristics, was reduced by 40% by the addition of 10 phr NdFeB fillers because of the inhibition of the stress-induced crystallization. However, the variation in loading from 30-90 phr has modest effects on the tensile strength as well as elongation at break and the hardness. Furthermore, recycled NdFeB-NR composites had higher modulus and lower percentage of swelling in this magnetic loading regime. Simple tests confirmed the distribution of magnetic stray field around pieces of NdFeB-NR composites. © Indian Academy of Sciences.",

  "abstract": "We studied the effects of thickness and heat treatments on giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) of cobalt-coated silver wires from 1 kHz to 100 MHz, under axial static magnetic field of 2 kOe. Cobalt, of thickness ranging from 1 to 25 μm, was electro-deposited on 47.7-μm-diameter silver wires. The frequency dependence of GMI varied with cobalt thickness with a maximum of 176% in 10-μm-thick cobalt at the characteristic frequency 2 MHz. The characteristic frequency decreased with increasing thickness of cobalt layer but it was rather insensitive to dc Joule heating and conventional furnace annealing. However, both heat treatments led to magnetic hardening and decrease in GMI ratio. Joule heating also induced anisotropy in wire structures normally dominated by axial anisotropy. © 2006 IEEE.",

  "abstract": "A burgeoning trend in spin electronics is the development of spin-sensitive semiconductor devices. Implementing spin-polarized carriers in semiconductors expands potential device functionality by differentiating between up and down spin carriers in both the conduction and valence bands. This spin selectivity may be realized by using magnetic semiconductors or by employing external spin-selective ferromagnets to inject spin-polarized current into nonmagnetic semiconductors. As the length scales are reduced, ferromagnetic single electron devices become feasible. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

  "abstract": "Giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) has been measured in pieces of silicon steel (4.5% Si) as functions of axial static magnetic field, sample width, frequency and magnitude of the AC driving current. The samples, 0.5×35mm with widths ranging from 0.122 to 1.064mm, were cut from sheets of commercial transformer cores. The impedance decreased with an applied magnetic field and saturated under 1.5kOe. GMI ratio (ΔZ/Z) increased at low frequencies, reached the maximum at the characteristic frequency and decreased at frequencies above the characteristic value. With increasing width of the samples, the characteristic frequency decreases but the GMI ratio increases. The maximum 300% GMI ratio was observed at the frequency about 200kHz for a 1.064mm wide sample. A rise of GMI ratio started and reached the maximum at lower frequencies for wider samples. Finally, GMI ratio increased with increasing AC current from 2.5 to 10mA but this variation is modest in a high-frequency regime. The results can be explained by the dependence of the transverse permeability on the magnetic field, frequency and magnitude of AC current. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Large negative magnetoresistance (MR) in mechanically alloyed, Cobalt-copper (Co-Cu) powder was observed at room temperature. Cu-Co powder (atomic ratio 30:70) milled for 30, 60 and 120 h was packed in plastic capsules with the bulk densities of 2.68-3.96 g/cm3. At room temperature, the alloyed Co-Cu capsules showed up to 70% decrease in electrical resistance when they were subjected to 11 kOe applied magnetic field. It was proposed that the movement of loosely packed Co-rich cluster under the magnetic field, was the origin of this MR. The movement provided the more efficient electron pathways resulting in resistance decrease. The variation of the MR ratio was closely related to the milling time and the packed bulk density. With the same milling time, the optimum packed bulk density led to the highest MR ratio and the effect was suppressed at higher densities such as in pressed pellets. By virtue of fracturing and cold welding, the milling changed the cluster size distribution and intercluster distance. The structural, magnetic and thermal properties were also studied in order to understand the effect of the milling time on the alloyed powder. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "A silicon-based spin transistor of novel operating principle has been demonstrated in which the current gain at room temperature is 1.4 (n-type) and 0.97 (p-type). This high current gain was obtained from a hybrid metal/semiconductor analogue to the bipolar junction transistor which functions by tunnel-injecting carriers from a ferromagnetic emitter into a diffusion driven silicon base and then tunnel-collecting them via a ferromagnetic collector. The switching of the magnetic state of the collector ferromagnet controls the collector efficiency and the current gain. Furthermore, the magnetocurrent, which is determined to be 98% (140%) for p-type (n-type) in -110 Oe, is attributable to the spin-polarized base diffusion current.",

Their hysteresis loops from longitudinal and polar magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) magnetometry differed from typical characteristics of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy but still indicated the preference of in-plane anisotropy over perpendicular anisotropy. The longitudinal hysteresis loop of the 68 nm-thick film was decidedly in a transcritical state signified by an enhanced coercive field. Changing the angle (θ) between the 2500 Oe-magnetic field and the current gave rise to the change in electrical resistance (R θ) of 29 nm-thick film and the plot between R θ and cos 2 θ could be linearly fitted. The changes in resistance due to this anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect ranged from-0.08 % (θ = 90°) to +0.04 % (θ = 0°).",

  "abstract": "In this work, electroactive polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was a matrix for dispersing 10 wt % ferromagnetic nickel (Ni) particles. The composites were formed into its shape by using a spin coater with varying spinning speeds from 750 to 3750 rpm to obtain the thicknesses between 68 μm and 40 μm on printed circuit board substrates. Magnetic hysteresis loops of the composites were dependent on the spinning speed because the spin regulated the dispersion and size distribution of Ni particles in the PVDF matrix. Owing to the Ni agglomeration, the composites prepared by 750, 1500 and 2250 rpm spinning clearly displayed soft ferromagnetic properties but the capacitance was decreased with the decrease in spinning speed. In every sample, the capacitance was reduced with the increase in frequency from 1 kHz to 100 kHz and remained minimal up to 1 MHz. These changes in capacitance can be explained by the polarization of surface charges of Ni clusters of varying sizes from different spinning speeds. The dissipation factor was, by contrast, sensitive to the frequency and the dispersion of Ni only at frequencies higher than 60 kHz. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter · Berlin · Boston.",

This quantitative study used a questionnaire to collect data from chief executive officers (CEOs) and engineers of various companies in the auto parts industry, a crucial income-generator for Thailand. Partial least squares structural equation modeling, which assesses reflective and structural models, was adopted to test the hypotheses. The findings revealed significant influences among the six pairs of constructed relationships. Indeed, investigations found in this study indicated that (1) KBDCs had a positive effect on DT; (2) KBDCs and DT had a positive effect on OSI; and (3) KBDCs, DT, and OSI had a positive effect on HPOs. The analytical results of this empirical study also provided information to expand the knowledge of strategic intuition (SI). The practical contribution of this study is a consolidated comprehensive framework of OSI that contained vital insights for CEOs, policymakers, and practitioners to support the creation of OSI, leading to better strategic decisions. © 2022 by the authors.",

  "abstract": "Economic growth can be defined by real gross domestic value and international imports and exports supported by technology and innovation. Currently, there are concerns about the level of international technological policy investment, despite having the capability to be macroeconomically and business-valuable. The main objective of this research is to study the attributions in relationships and associations between the policy implications of technological business (PITB) and the effort of technology and innovation acceptance capacity (TIAC), which influence capacity development and foresight to ensure effective Japanese foreign policies. This research has been fully justified through business policy receiving technology and innovation, the potential for technology and innovation adoption (PTIA) and innovation for firm performance (IFP) of Japanese joint venture companies in Thailand was examined. Fifty-seven companies were subjected to the structural equation model testing method. Data collection was conducted by the questionnaire and an in-depth interview with validity and reliability checked under 4 main latent variables: PITB, TIAC, PTIA, and IFP. All processing was performed with the ADANCO 2.2.1 program. The research found that PITB had a positive correlation and directly influenced PTIA and IFP unless it had an inverse correlation to TIAC and the relationship between TIAC and PTIA. It can serve as a guide for how to correctly carry out the principle of creating a new Japan's foreign policy in the future. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.",

  "abstract": "Purpose: This research intended to investigate the motivation and behavior of free independent travelers (FITs) who traveled to Southern Thailand in the Covid-19 pandemic. Theoretical framework: Studies on tourist motivation and behavior would provide more insightful implications and Covid-19 safeguards for tourism businesses especially in Southern Thailand – a dominant destination for domestic tourism demand. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from 400 domestic FITs using a questionnaire survey, processed in SPSS software, and analyzed with descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and One-way ANOVA. Findings: The highest level of overall pull and push motivations of domestic FITs while traveling to Southern Thailand. The highest level of pull motivation identified in this study was a promotional scheme, called “WE TRAVEL TOGETHER” the government-subsidized 40% of accommodation expenses to increase tourism demand. Research, Practical & Social implications: Comparative responses to SHA Plus standard between domestic and international tourists using both qualitative and quantitative data from all stakeholders involved would provide a variety of insightful and beneficial perspectives on NNT in the Covid-19 pandemic. Originality/value: CCSA should pay more attention on this particular behavior of tourists which might easily spread the disease to others. Everyone should be more aware of this risk and show their greater responsible practice in society. © 2022 AOS-Estratagia and Inovacao. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Despite their significant impact on most economies and their role as a measure of innovation and the development of a country's economic stability, startup firms' failure rates remain high. To maintain survival and improve competitive performance, startup firms must utilize both internal and external resources. Previous studies have examined the factors that improve the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or large companies, but few studies have examined the influence of dynamic capability on startup competitive performance. Thus, this study examined the effect of dynamic talent management capabilities on the competitive performance of startup companies. It considered the importance of dynamic marketing capability as a mediating variable in the relationship between dynamic talent management capability and competitive performance. The study's sample comprised of 170 startups registered with the National Innovation Agency (a public agency) of Thailand's Ministry of Science and Technology. The findings revealed that dynamic talent management capability had a positive impact on performance. Startup firms with talent management strategies could enhance their competitive performance. Furthermore, dynamic marketing capability mediated the relationship between dynamic talent management capability and performance. These results suggested that human capital with dynamic talent management capabilities in combination with dynamic marketing capabilities can support startup firms to improve competitive finance, market, and innovation performance to meet the needs of talented employees, customers, and investors. This study contributes to the knowledge management, marketing, competitiveness, and innovation literature and supports existing findings. © 2023 Journal of Competitiveness. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Cost management is the strategy of planning and controlling the costs associated with operating a business. The frugal innovation (FI) approach is therefore interesting because it is a way to reduce costs while innovating without requiring a high level of investments in capital, technology, and skills. Therefore, to understand the mechanism of FI development, this research aims to study the relationships and influences among the diagnostic capabilities (DiC), dynamic capabilities (DyC), and frugal process innovation (FPI) of Thai small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which require a cost strategy to stay in the highly competitive auto parts industry. Causal research was conducted through surveys using questionnaires for data collection. Respondents were chief executive officers (CEOs), engineers, and senior technicians in their respective companies. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess the structural models and verify the research hypotheses. The findings revealed significant influences among three pairs of constructs: (1) DiC has a positive effect on DyC, (2) DyC has a positive effect on FPI, and (3) DiC has a positive effect on FPI. Accordingly, the results of this research reveal a guideline for FI development by creating DiC and improving organizational DyC. These notions improve organizational preparation for unexpected situations in the future. © 2022 The Authors",

  "abstract": "Tourism is an important sector that generates economic income in Thailand, and revenue is obtained from seaside tourism, wellness tourism and cultural tourism. Hot spring wellness tourism is gaining more attention and popularity among tourists. Therefore, through the use of a SWOT analysis, the TOWS matrix-based analytical hierarchy process (AHP), semi-structured interviews, and a focus group with 67 stakeholders, this research investigates the guidelines for the promotion and development of hot spring wellness tourism. The study found that the development approach can be divided into four dimensions: 1) Demand-side development focuses on promoting tourism through the use of various media and by creating an identity through tourism publicity, as well as generating income for people in the community and developing an international tourist destination focusing on promoting wellness-conscious tourists. 2) Supply-side development focuses on improving the quality of the hot springs tourist destination, improving the landscape to accommodate a full range of tourists, and developing tourist attractions and new tourism activities, including the development of tourism links with other sectors. 3) The mechanism development side focuses on the development of a comprehensive tourism management system and the determination of the appropriate utilization zones of tourist attractions. 4) Service quality development is based on an important objective, namely, the development of tourism personnel that meet international standards to support the expansion of tourism in the future and the development of first aid and security systems. © 2023, GMSARN International Journal.

The situation of spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in businesses and labor departments having to adapt to survive by upgrading existing knowledge and adding new skills. Therefore, this research aims to describe components and models of necessary skills development for performance affecting dynamic capabilities and performance in a new normal era for human resources managers of five-star hotels in Phuket Province, which are crucial components in an increased corporation’s sustainability and performance in terms of personnel efficiency, assets, funds, and information. This research is quantitative, and research data was collected from a total of 384 human resource managers of five-star hotels. There was a mutual discussion of factor analysis and structural equation results with three human resources managers who have been successful for not less than seven years in their work. The components consisted of systematic consideration through the following causes: necessary skills; professional skills, work skills, and emotional skills, mediator variables; dynamic capabilities, and organizational performance. This research also discussed five guidelines for developing the necessary skills for performance. As various factors have affected the performance in the new normal era, the human resources executives of five-star hotels in Phuket province should apply them and consider them together with their business plans for setting the strategic plan of organizational management, management, administrative, and human resources development. © Authors retain all copyrights.",

  "abstract": "This research aims to study the effects of technological organization, management of cost innovation, and value creation. The population in this study was the canned and instant food export companies, which are crucial industries that earn incomes for Thailand. The quantitative research method was carried out using questionnaires sent to all companies (census) with the manufacturing managers as respondents. The survey revealed that these companies had a high level of technological organization, value creation, and cost innovation, except for reducing unnecessary functions at a moderate level because the products need to maintain customer demand; therefore, unnecessary adjustments may not be made. PLS-SEM assesses the reflective and structural models to test the research hypotheses. The findings revealed significant influences among three pairs of constructs: (1) technological organization had a positive effect on cost innovation, (2) cost innovation had a positive effect on value creation, and (3) technological organization had a positive effect on value creation. Thus, this research provides empirical information for the influences among the variables and presents the significance of being a technological organization and the inclusion of cost innovation management, to maintain their business during the COVID-19 pandemic and improve the organizational potential for preparation in future circumstances. © 2022 by the authors.

(2) To study the importance of clarity of strategy and goal setting affecting the SPM and HPO of the local hotel businesses. And (3) To propose the models in developing SPM for HPO of local hotel businesses. Questionnaires have been sent to 352 people of the local hotel businesses whose owners are Thais and are not chain hotels, accredited with no less than 3 standard stars, and operated in Samui island, Thailand. The data are then analyzed using regression analysis. The result of the hypothesis test on the relation between factors affecting HPO of the local hotel businesses shows that clarity of strategy and goal setting factor, SPM factor i.e. learning and development measure variables, and social and environment measure variables affect the HPO. All of the variables can help explain the HPO of the local hotels by 67.4% with significant statistical implications. The factors that affect or are most powerful in predicting changes in HPO of the local hotels are learning and development measure, clarity of strategy and goal setting, and social and environment measure respectively. Findings should be useful for local hotel managers who aim to enhance the HPO that will increase the competitive advantage. © 2020 Publishing India Group. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "This paper examines issues relating to Japan’s digital advance policy (DAP) for ASEAN countries during the period 2015-2019, which aimed at broadening the spectrum of digital economic growth. The study sought to gain insights into the impacts of respective policies of ASEAN, Japan Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Japanese digital foreign direct investment (FDI), and Japanese enterprises. The study also examined workflow structure processes to explain how Japan’s DAP contributes to ASEAN’s innovation business. This research is categorized as a reconnaissance study, based on empirical analysis of pertinent existing evidence, complemented by 74 in-depth interviews with key experts from ASEAN, JICA, CSTI and major digital enterprises from 5 ASEAN countries. The findings indicate a need to redirect the innovation business of Japan’s DAP as well as ASEAN’s innovation business and to enhance their mutual alignment. Four key entry points are proposed: (1) policymakers, (2) private sector businesses, (3) goalkeeper science, and (4) innovative infrastructure. This paper also provides guidelines and support to validate key performance indicators of Japan’s DAP in ASEAN countries. The studies how Japan’s digital holistic platforms could be transferred to ASEAN countries under the DAP. It also examines the relationship between key performance indicators of Japan’s outward FDI in ASEAN digital businesses and growth in ASEAN’s innovation business. © Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.

This study has investigated determinants and consequences of integrated financial reporting by analyzing Form 56-1 for year-end 2015 of the 240 Thai listed firms. To examine the relationship, an integrated financial reporting checklist was developed to identify the level of integrated reporting of listed firms on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. An index was based on seven dimensions of the International Integrated Reporting Framework. An integrated financial reporting is then analyzed using content analysis. An integrated financial reporting and corporate governance mechanism were collected from Form 56-1 for year-end 2015. Investment risk data was collected from SETSMART database. The analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM). The statistical results from factor analysis found that all seven dimensions are appropriate measurements of integrated financial reporting. The empirical result is that positive relationships were found for stakeholder-oriented corporate governance mechanism, shareholder-oriented corporate governance mechanism and integrated financial reporting; integrated financial reporting and investment risk. The model identified mediating relationship of integrated financial reporting between shareholder-oriented corporate governance mechanism and investment risk. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.",

In this study, we found that the performance measurement of local hotel businesses on Samui Island, Thailand, a global tourism destination, was composed of various components. Each component was integrated; the performance measurements of each component are not undertaken separately. The financial aspect is not the sole focal component; rather, it is connected to other aspects, i.e., the operation and stakeholder relationship. The financial aspect of the local hotels, on the other hand, includes measurements of income and return on investment. In addition, the operation of the businesses emphasises the satisfaction with the customer service, while the stakeholder relationship stresses customer loyalty. Importantly, a sense of ownership on the part of the personnel, trust in their colleagues, and a sense of being a part of the community in which the businesses operate are all taken into consideration. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.",

The data was collected using a cross-sectional quantitative survey. A total of 292 useable responses were collected from Thai Processed Food Exporters (TPFE). The findings also indicated that the hypothesized relationships between the independent and dependent variables fit the empirical data. Specifically, it is revealed that strategic intuition, business analytic capabilities, networkbased capabilities and dynamic capabilities had a direct effect on dynamic strategy. They also had statistically significant direct and indirect effects on dynamic performance. Based on the results of the correlation test, the researchers developed a dynamic capability model for the development of the dynamic performance of the operators, which included concepts, principles, methods, tools and guidelines. Furthermore, the impacts of intuition, business analytic, networking capabilities on dynamic strategy are also examined in this study. It makes a considerable contribution to the existing literature on dynamic strategy of TPFE, particularly in regards to explaining the performance. © Korean Distribution Science Association (KODISA).",

  "abstract": "Background: Although the concept of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) was designed for profit-based organisa-tions, the application of the BSC in public and nonprofit organisations (NPOs) could be performed within the NPOs and public health sector, as the conceptual foundation of this system was developed from community hospitals performance. Methods: This study used the BSC concept to analyse the 16 key performance indicators and trends of performance during the last five years of 52 community hospitals located in upper southern Thailand in 2017 and tendency of 2013-2017. The instruments included an annual report and a questionnaire. A statistical analysis to determine percentages, means and standard deviations was performed. Results: The major findings of the community hospitals performance were as follows: Customer perspective: 1. Patient complaint rate of 0.0097% and 2. Outpatient waiting time of 91.89 minutes, Financial perspective: 1. Ratio of total revenue to total expense at 0.9949 and 2. Cost of drugs and materials to total expense at 13.32%, Internal process perspective: 1. Bed turnover at 88.16 and 2. Hospital infection rate of 0.379 times:1,000 patient days, Learning and growth perspective: 1. Staff turnover rate of 4.69% and 2. Number of research studies at 3.77 articles. Trends and performance of hospitals in every perspective of the BSC in the last 5 years showed no differences. Conclusion: The community hospitals offer services such as treatment of common diseases. If the community hospitals could not assist, they will go to referral system by referring patients to secondary and tertiary care respectively. © 2020, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

  "abstract": "Purpose - The fact that Thailand has been a popular destination among global tourists has created challenges for hotel businesses to achieve high performance with excellent services that are responsive to the needs of global travelers. This article aims to provide empirical evidence on the causal relationships among the effects of the dynamic capabilities, high-performance organization and organizational performance of hotel businesses in a world-class tourism destination. Design - Theoretical views on management were gathered to create a conceptual framework that is the source of different performance results and that has 2 main factors: (1) dynamic capabilities and (2) the high-performance organization. Methodology - This paper is quantitative research, using questionnaires to collect data from 109 hotel businesses located on Samui Island, Thailand. The data were first analyzed using descriptive statistics and were then compared by groups of hotel characteristics using t-tests and ANOVA. Finally, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were conducted. Findings - This study shows that hotel characteristics differently affected dynamic capabilities, the high-performance organization and performance. The results also indicate that the high-performance organization not only has a direct positive effect on performance but it also completely meditates the relationship between dynamic capabilities and performance. Originality of the research - The findings should be useful for hotel managers who aim to improve their hotels' dynamic capabilities to enhance the high-performance organization and firm performance. © 2019 University of Rijeka.

  "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to study the factors related to the performance of the entrepreneurs who passed through the stages of business development at the university business incubators in Thailand. These factors consist of various characteristics, namely, leadership orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, network capacity, and innovative capacity. The sample group consisted of 220 businesses that had passed through a university business incubator in Thailand. The SPSS Statistics program calculated the basic statistics, as well as the relationship test for each factor studied, and examined the statistics using a structural equation model (SEM). The results revealed that the characteristics of leadership orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, network capacity, innovative capacity, and entrepreneurial performance had relationships in the same direction. Furthermore, an analysis of the relationships between the factors found that entrepreneurial orientation had positive relationships with network capacity and innovative capacity, leadership orientation had positive relationships with innovative capacity and entrepreneurial performance, and innovative capacity had a positive relationship with entrepreneurial performance. These relationships summarize a developmental model for the innovative capacity and performance of businesses that have passed through the university business incubators in Thailand. © 2019 by the authors.",

  "abstract": "Purpose: This purpose of this paper is to synthesize and propose the indicators of knowledge management capability (KMC) in different knowledge management (KM) processes to assess KM effectiveness. It also intends to provide useful indicators for those who are interested in the study of KMC to create effective KM, who can utilize the aforementioned indicators as guidelines in the development of empirical definitions by testing them. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a literature review research, through which indicators of KMC for KM effectiveness are synthesized, utilizing related documents, literature and other research studies and the characteristics of which are evaluated by the KM experts as specified in qualitative research. Findings: The results of the research suggest two main aspects of KMC for KM effectiveness: first, a resource-based perspective, which comprises technology, structure and culture; and second, a knowledge-based perspective, which comprises expertise, learning and information. It is suggested that there are 84 indicators in KMC for KM effectiveness, which can be divided into: 22 indicators on KMC-knowledge acquisition; 21 indicators on KMC-knowledge creation; 19 indicators on KMC-knowledge storage; and 22 indicators on KMC-knowledge application. Originality/value: Apparently the existing research concerning KMC does not reveal clear conclusions nor designate indicators of KMC in both aspects: resource-based perspective and knowledge-based perspective. The consequence is a lack of direction and precision in developing KMC to achieve its effectiveness. This paper therefore provides clear visions on important aspects of KMC whereby the various indicators of their components need to be developed to enrich the concept and further the development of KM. It also provides future researchers with useful means to assess the KM effectiveness in different KM processes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

  "abstract": "This exploratory research investigates how firms upgrade their strategic capabilities for superior returns of current markets and enable their entry into a new industry. The study explores how the current successful entrepreneurs build their organisation’s strategic capabilities and achieve their sustained strategic capabilities in today’s rapidly changing environment. As this is an exploratory study, a qualitative approach is used. We first interviewed the expert academicians in strategic management in order to validate and verify our research instrument. We then interviewed the sample successful entrepreneurs in the rubber industry in the South of Thailand on how they developed and adapted their strategies over time to sustain their competitiveness in the relevant product markets. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate how a successful company of latex product export industry became competitive in its new industry entry. This study finds that there is a positive systematic relationship between organisational strategic capabilities, namely resource-based capabilities (RBCs), knowledge-based capabilities (KBCs), network-based capabilities (NBCs), and organisational dynamic strategies. This relationship is linked to the development of a dynamic, process-oriented strategy that seeks to maintain a higher return on investment and to focus on new markets. This study contributes to the theoretical knowledge of strategic management, and its practical implication is that entrepreneurs should focus on developing dynamic capabilities of their firm to cope with the constantly changing environment nowadays. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",

The results will serve as a guideline for creating a model to develop the strategic intuition capability of entrepreneurs in Thailand in the future. The research studies relevant literature from empirical data and tests the consistency of a linear structural relationship model by using component analysis techniques. A questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of entrepreneurs who are SMEs from the database of the Thailand Exporter Directory, the Ministry of Commerce. The results showed that the developed strategic intuition model is in harmony with empirical data, with the strategic intuition variables consisting of three main components: (1) Sensing capabilities, (2) Aggressive thinking capabilities, and (3) Strategic decision capabilities, with a positive value. It was also found that in each component of the measurement model, strategic insight had the same straightness, and the variability of the structural confidence values passed the standard criteria. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.",

An empirical study was conducted on 4-to 5-star hotels in Phuket Province seeking to become sustainable businesses by increasing the efficiency of performance and setting guidelines for hotel businesses to form a performance model relating to administration and human resource development in the midst of ongoing environmental changes. Questionnaires were used to collect data from 405 human resources executives of 4-5 stars hotels in Phuket Province, Thailand. The data analysis first involved applying descriptive statistics and then adopting Pearson correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. The results show that innovative behaviour has had a positive effect on task performance and that causal factors including valuable human resources, transformational leadership, and innovation atmosphere have had a direct positive impact on innovative behaviour. Furthermore, we found positive direct and indirect effects on task performance. © 2021. TEM Journal. All Rights Reserved.",

Plant samples were collected from 6 waterfalls in the southern part of the park. Thirty-four species in 10 genera, 3 tribes of Zingiberaceae were collected. A key to species for each genus is provided. Four taxa could not yet be identified. Ka Rome waterfall has the highest number of Zingiberaceae species (23 species in 10 genera, H’ = 3.091, D’ = 0.948) because this area may be less disturbed. Some areas of the park were degraded and changed to plantations, such as Wang Mai Pak waterfall, which has the lowest number of species (13 species in 7 genera, H’ = 2.432, D’ = 0.904). Information on traditional uses of the collected plants was gathered by interviewing villagers and folks who live nearby the areas. Zingiberaceae plants are found to be important natural resources for villagers and mostly used as medicines, foods, drinks, and ornaments. © 2015, Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "The use of Ecofonts in printing can result in economic savings and lower environmental impact. However, most of the research on the use of Ecofonts focuses on Latin alphabets. Moreover, texts printed with Ecofonts can be perceived as being less legible than those printed with the original typefaces. This study (a) assesses toner use reductions in documents printed with English and Thai Ecofonts, and (b) studies the observers’ perception of texts printed either with Ecofonts or with original typefaces. To achieve this, black pixels were removed from 10 English and 13 Thai typefaces widely used in academia and other media. Visibility and legibility tests, as well as mass analyses tests, were then performed on texts printed with some such typefaces. Results from instrumental measurements and digital image analyses show that the use of Ecofonts reduces toner use of an inkjet printer by up to 28%. The study also proposes a new Ecofont typeface for the Thai language. Visual tests showed that the visual experience of text printed using this Thai Ecofont is satisfactory. Awareness of the benefits of using Ecofonts changes the users’ attitudes towards the printing quality of Ecofont. The removal of black pixels can lead to more sustainable printing, and this simple solution can be extended to other non-Latin languages as part of the global Green Information Technology efforts in South-East Asia. © 2021 by the authors.",

  "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to see how a student potential support program affected drowning prevention among primary school students in Nakhon Si Thammarat. This study was quasi-experimental. The sample consisted of students in Grades 1–6 who were randomly selected based on the inclusion criteria. The experimental and control groups had 120 participants. The experimental group was given the program (House, 1981), while the control group was to resume normal activities. The program lasted 8 weeks. The research instruments and data collection included the program and assessment forms on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in drowning prevention. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square statistics, paired sample t-tests, and independent t-tests were employed for the analysis of the data. The results show that the samples were 7–12 years of age (M = 9.50, SD = 1.72), with male and female students accounting for 37.5, and 62.5 percent, respectively; and 73.33 percent of them lived with their parents. The mean scores of the students in the control and experimental groups before using the program had no statistically significant differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (p > 0.05). As for the mean scores of the students’ potential for drowning prevention in the experimental group before and after using the program, it was found that after the program there was a marked increase in all aspects with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001): before and after in knowledge (M = 17.08, SD = 3.22; M = 19.15, SD = 1.79, respectively), before and after in attitudes (M = 48.48, SD = 6.24; M = 55.23, SD = 4.66, respectively), and before and after in behaviors (M = 17.97, SD = 3.13; M = 21.00, SD = 2.50, respectively). The mean scores of the students’ potential for drowning prevention in the experimental group after using the program was higher than in the control group, with statistically significant differences in all aspects (p < 0.001): in the experimental group, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (M = 19.15, SD = 1.79; M = 55.23, SD = 4.66; M = 21.00, SD = 2.50; respectively); and in the control group, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (M = 16.15, SD = 3.22; M = 48.37, SD = 3.61; M = 17.85, SD = 2.64; respectively). The program can help students develop better drowning prevention knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. It can assist students in being able to protect themselves from drowning in risky situations. © 2022 by the authors.",

  "abstract": "Anemia is a significant public health problem among children, especially school-age children, because their body quickly produces red blood cells to provide sufficient blood volume with plasma expansion to maintain blood concentration. This research aimed to study the anemia situation, knowledge about anemia, food consumption behaviors, and the association between knowledge, food consumption behaviors, and hematocrit level among school-age children in primary school, in Thasala district, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province. This is a descriptive study among 408 students in grades 4 to 6, aged 9–12 years. Research instruments included the children’s demographic data of the children, their knowledge about anemia, and food consumption behaviors, and hematocrit assessment. Data were analyzed using descriptive, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and logistic regression statistics. The results revealed that 23.2% of the samples had anemia, 0.98% had moderate anemia, and 22.22% had mild anemia. The children knew about anemia, with the mean score at a moderate level (mean = 6.63; SD = 2.51) out of 10. The mean score on food consumption behaviors was at a moderate level (mean = 17.49; SD = 3.68) out of 24. There were significantly positive correlations between the knowledge about anemia and hematocrit level at a moderate level (r = 0.45, p < 0.001). Food consumption behaviors were moderately correlated with hematocrit level (r = 0.40, p < 0.001). Confirmation with logistic regression found that knowledge about anemia (OR = 9.15, 95% CI: 4.57–18.34) and food consumption behaviors (OR = 19.09, 95% CI: 9.71–37.53) were significantly associated with hematocrit level. Conclusions: This study showed that knowledge about anemia and appropriate food consumption behaviors are associated with hematocrit levels. Enhancing knowledge about anemia and food consumption behaviors may reduce the prevalence of anemia in school-age children. Health care providers in primary care should provide health education and encourage children to eat sufficient food. © 2022 by the authors.",

  "abstract": "We developed and implemented an assessment and intervention program that can be used as psychosocial first aid for children caught up in a humanitarian emergency. We developed training modules for professionals in this aspect of disaster relief. We based this in regional institutions, so that the program would have wide implementation across the country. Because this disaster was not anticipated, we were fortunate to have a group of previously trained individuals who were able to implement the knowledge and skills required to do workforce training. We would have liked to have used more rigorous program assessment activities, but there was no time to do so. More communities and countries need to do more disaster preparation that includes psychosocial first aid for children. It is important that multiple modalities of psychosocial assistance be used and available to strengthen families, to restore livelihoods, and to revitalize communities in the aftermath of a disaster. The use of the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale proved useful, and we recommend its development as a tool for testing the effectiveness of psychosocial first aid.",

Here, using RT-PCR, we have identified both the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT7 receptor transcripts in the rabbit retina. Furthermore, we found the same two receptors in the rat retina which was previously believed not to have a serotoninergic system. These results confirm previous reports of 5-HT7 gene expression in retina and together with other biochemical, physiological and anatomical studies, they support the presence of multiple 5-HT receptors in the mammalian retina and suggest that the action of serotonin in the retina may be more complicated than previously believed.

Methods: This research was quasi-experimental research, using the subjects consisted of 130 samples; each of the experimental and control group consisted of 65 samples. The experimental group received a self-efficacy enhancement program. The control group received knowledge and usual care by health personnel in the health promoting hospital. The duration of the research was 8 weeks. The self-efficacy was testing the reliability equal to 0.90. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and t-test. Results: The mean scores of perceived self-efficacy between the experimental and control group before using the program (M=2.18, S.D.=0.40; M=2.22, S.D.=0.39), there was no significantly different (p> 0.05). The mean scores of perceived self-efficacy between the experimental and control group after using the program (M=4.11, S.D.=0.44; M=2.28, S.D.=0.42), there was a significantly different (p< 0.001). The mean scores of perceived self-efficacy of the experimental group before and after using the program were higher, (M=2.18, S.D.=0.40; M=4.11, S.D.=0.44), there was a significantly different (p< 0.001). The experimental group came to screening 64 people (98.5 %), and the control group came to screening eight people (12.3 %), calculated ratio as 8:1 and compared the cervical cancer screening in the experimental and control group had differences significantly (p< 0.001). Conclusion: The self-efficacy enhancement program, resulting in increased screening rates and screened after the first week by having most screening tests in the community.

This study aimed to investigate the suspected delay in language development and the factors associated with the suspected delay in language development among early childhood in Southern Thailand. Children aged 24 to 60 months were recruited as study samples using stratified random sampling conducted in 23 districts and simple random sampling in 7 sections (425 children). The research instruments comprised demographic data on the children and families, the preschool temperament questionnaire, and the Language Development Screening questionnaire using the Developmental Surveillance and Promotion Manual and data collected from July 2020 to January 2021. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and logistic regression. The results showed that the suspected delay in development was 40.9 percent. Daily screen time exceeding 2 h per day (AOR = 17.30, 95% CI: 7.35–40.72), and regarding a child’s temperament, moderate-to-difficult temperament (AOR = 9.56, 95% CI: 5.12–17.85) was significantly associated with the suspected delay in language development. Genders, gestational age of early childhood, and the age of the caregivers were not associated with the suspected delay in language development. The study suggested that a decrease in daily screen time and appropriate responses will help develop language in children. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

This study investigated family management of children with chronic diseases, quality of life of children, and correlation between family management of caregivers and quality of life of children as perceived by the caregivers. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study collected data from 200 pairs of caregivers and children with asthma, anemia, and thalassemia aged 5 to 12 years after receiving treatment and follow-up in the pediatric outpatient department of the tertiary hospital, June to November 2020. Research instruments comprised a Family Management Measure (FaMM) and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0). Data were analyzed using descriptive and Spearman rank correlation coefficient statistics. Results: The caregivers of children obtained a mean score on family management of 166.88 (S. D.= 11.32). The quality of life of children with chronic illness had a mean score of 66.59 (S.D.= 18.63). Correlation analysis revealed that easy family management of the caregivers had a positive correlation with the quality of life of children with chronic diseases. On the contrary, difficulty in family management negatively correlated with the quality of life of the children. Conclusion: Most caregivers could have easy family management in caring for the children. In summary, easy family management will allow children with chronic illness to receive decent care from their caregivers, contributing to improved quality of life. © 2021 Sutthisompohn and Kusol. com/terms.php and incorporate the.",

  "abstract": "Background: Storytelling, a common family activity for preschool children to develop their literacy, can be used to promote learning of a language other than the mother-tongue, hence a starting point of home education for early childhood. Aim: The study aims to integrate storytelling as a family activity that helps to promote learning of English vocabulary for preschoolers. Setting: Young children aged 3–5 years and their parents living in a small neighbourhood of Muang District, province of Suratthani, in the south of Thailand attended the study during the restriction imposed to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic under the ‘Stay at Home’ measures (March–April 2020). Both parents and children were given information about the study before they decided whether or not to participate in the project by parents’ informed consent for their child to be involved. Methods: The data were collected in four stages: pretest, storytelling, post-test and interview. The storytelling material included five stories, particularly composed for the study. These stories were written in Thai (average 423 words), each with three English words inserted, making up 15 English words as the test items. Analyses were conducted on the pre-and post-test scores, observation of children’s learning performance and parents’ reflection. Results: The preschoolers showed vocabulary development from listening to the in-house stories. On average, children obtained 12.2 scores out of 15 words in the post-test versus 8 scores in the pretest. The family’s satisfaction level was high, that is, 3.5 from 4 on children’s learning behaviour and English word development and 3.77 on stories appreciation. The preschoolers requested to hear a story as many as three times in order to be confident. The high frequency of hearing tended to predict individual’s development. Conclusion: Storytelling promoted English vocabulary learning and it could be done at home, provided that parents are equipped with appropriate material. In a story, preschoolers should be introduced to mono-syllabic concrete words and only up to three words at a time. Repetition of at least three times is necessary. © 2021. The Authors.",

  "abstract": "Wood drying is a key operation of wood processing to ensure that the wood retains its physical integrity and stability in remanufacturing and in use. However, in industrial drying various drying defects still occur, which include uneven moisture content between and within boards, board distortion, residual drying stresses that may induce internal and external checking, and wood collapse. This paper presents a review on advances in wood drying research and development, which lay foundation for better understanding of the drying process, mechanisms of drying defect occurrence and affecting factors. In particular, recent progresses in understanding drying stress development and wood collapse formation during drying are presented in more details. Based on these advances, inter-linkage and interactions are analyzed among wood physical and microstructural properties, moisture movement in wood during drying, stress development and reversal, and wood collapse formation. Following this, drying schedule improvements and novel drying technologies are presented with targets to mitigate the drying defects, reduce energy consumption and increase the productivity. Application of artificial intelligence for modeling and control of the timber drying is also briefly described. Finally, recommendations are made for future studies and practical implementation. © 2023 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

  "abstract": "Dried fish is a rich source of protein and other nutrients but is highly susceptible to spoilage by moulds. The objective of this study was to develop smoke-flavour antimicrobial packaging from coconut fibre made from Litsea cubeba oil (LC) at 0.03%, 0.06%, and 0.09%w/w combined with wood smoking (WS) for 30, 45, and 60 min. Results showed that the developed packaging containing 0.06% LC and WS for 60 min could completely inhibit growth of spoilage mould and mould disease (Aspergillus niger) on dried fish. In addition, smoke flavour and LC vapour from the treated packaging could be absorbed into the surface of dried fish, improving its organoleptic properties and consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, treated dried fish kept in the developed packaging had a smoky flavour similar to smoked fish (p > 0.05). Use of the developed packaging reduced microbial load and extended the shelf life of dried fish stored at 30 ± 2 °C from five days to 21 days. The dried fish kept in the packaging showed no significant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compared to traditional smoked fish (p < 0.05). The physicochemical properties (pH, aw, L*a*b* value and hardness) of dried fish decreased during storage but remained at an acceptable level. Citral and limonene were found to be the main active compounds from the LC essential oil that inhibit mould growth. This finding suggested that keeping dried fish in the developed packaging could improve its organoleptic properties, reduce growth of microbial organisms and extend its shelf-life by a factor of three compared to the control. This could be extremely beneficial for the dried fish industry. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

The bacteriostatic properties of L. monocytogenes were investigated by cell constituent release analysis and crystal violet assays, which are related to the bacterial cell wall and cell membrane. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphology of L. Monocytogenes, and the components of LO in treated RTE mixed vegetable salads using were studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicated that LO at 100 μl L−1 could inhibit cell cultures and reduce the growth of L. monocytogenes (⁓104 cfu ml−1) on RTE salads in refrigerated conditions by 0.6–1.5 log10 cfu g−1. The results revealed that LO affected bacterial cell permeability and cell membrane integrity. The treated cells showed serious detrimental defects in their membrane morphology. Furthermore, α-terpineol, terpineol and limonene were confirmed as the key components that inhibited bacteria during cold storage. The quality of RTE salads stored with LO in a 1-L glass box showed good results, and the consumers also accepted the salads with a hedonic score (~6.1 ± 0.7) rated as ‘like slightly’ for sensory evaluation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "The controlled release of bergamot oil was evaluated from rubberwood boxes containing activated carbon and bergamot oil. Rubberwood boxes impregnated with different concentrations of bergamot oil (50, 100, and 300 µg g−1) with and without activated carbon were prepared. The treated rubberwood boxes were utilized to store strawberries at 6 °C for 21 d, while boxes with only activated carbon were used as a control. The inhibitory effects relative to Botrytis cinerea growth and quality of the strawberries after storage in rubberwood box were investigated. The microstructure of the rubberwood was evaluated via scanning electron microscopy. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry was used to quantify the volatile compounds. The rubberwood boxes with activated carbon and 100 µg g−1 of bergamot oil were found to inhibit Botrytis cinerea growth on strawberries and extend their shelf life for at least 21 d. Compared to rubberwood boxes without activated carbon, activated carbon was able to retard the release of bergamot oil into the system, yielding increased strawberry quality. Releasing less bioactive components from bergamot oil could decrease undesirable effects on strawberries, e.g., tissue, weight loss, flavour, and colour changes. © 2021, North Carolina State University.

  "abstract": "Coconut husk, rubberwood sawdust, and palm leaf base are cellulosic agricultural wastes that have potential to be processed to fiber as absorbing material. This study investigated characteristics (morphological, physiological properties, chemical composition, absorption capacity, and water absorption isotherms) of coconut, rubberwood, and palm fiber. Also, the study aimed to develop an antimicrobial sachet packaging to resist against foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli) by adding lime oil (LO) emulsion or Litsea cubeba (LC) oil at 50 to 700 μL into the material (1 g) before, and then dried and placed in the 1-L seal box. Results showed that among the three, coconut performed the best in terms of releasing the essential oil (EO) emulsion against bacteria. Coconut could adsorb and release volatile LO or LC at the lowest concentrations (LO, 500 μL/L; LC, 300 μL/L) to inhibit bacteria compared with the other fibers (700 }jL/L) at 35 °C. Results indicated that coconut has a low water absorption rate, which influenced the faster adsorption of EO emulsion in the beginning of the process; therefore, using low concentrations of EO in coconut for bacterial inhibition is possible. Coconut contains 34.5% lignin, 68.7% holocellulose, 37.6% cellulose, and 31.2% hemicellulose. Coconut is suitable as an alternative to the biocomposite material in developing a new antimicrobial packaging design. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.",

  "abstract": "Relatively large drying collapse has restricted the utilization of low-density oil palm wood (OPW), an agricultural waste in the palm oil industry, for several decades. This work reports a simple pretreatment that allows OPW from all sections of the trunk having a thickness of up to 0.2 m to be severely kiln-dried up to the temperature of 200 °C without any drying defects and with relatively low drying shrinkage. Lightweight characteristics and mechanical, thermal and acoustic properties of the dried OPW are maintained. The pretreatment process involves water impregnation of fresh OPW followed by freezing the OPW below the eutectic temperature of sap (water–sugar) of about −10 °C before kiln drying. This strategy creates localized microcracks at the pit cavities that connect between the parenchyma cells. These microcracks allow the short-range flow of intercellular liquid at atmospheric pressure to compensate for the negative capillary pressure of the intracellular liquid inside the parenchyma cell cavity during drying. A fraction of the intercellular liquid plays a crucial role in the formation of microcracks during freezing and the reduction of cell collapse during drying. The technique is also found to be applicable to the drying of the porous trunk of other palm species. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

  "abstract": "To prevent defects caused by drying collapse, transverse pre-mechanical compression with lateral restraint of green oil palm wood (OPW) before kiln-drying was performed. OPW specimens were divided according to specific gravity into low density (LD 0.22 ± 0.05) and medium-density (MD 0.33 ± 0.02) groups. Effects of compressive strain (0–0.65) and strain rate (0.01–1.0/min) on moisture removal and wood recovery after the compression and on collapse and internal void formations after kiln-drying were investigated. Results indicate that pre-mechanical compression linearly removes moisture out of wood and linearly generates permanent thickness strain that is independent of the strain rate used. The pre-compression reduces the true cross-sectional strain in the kiln-dried LD OPW and MD OPW and the internal voids caused by drying collapse in the LD OPW. The collapse-induced voids, not observed in all kiln-dried MD OPW, disappear when compressive strain > 0.45 is applied to the LD OPW. Microstructural examination reveals that directional folding of parenchyma cells caused by the compression reduces intercellular micro-voids randomly generated during drying by the non-directional collapse of parenchyma cells caused by capillary force. However, above the compressive strains of 0.35 and 0.25 in the LD OPW and MD OPW, interfacial micro-cracks, generated at the boundaries between the parenchyma cells and the fiber bundles, link to form shear bands at the angle of approximately 30–40° to the compression axis. After kiln-drying, these shear bands expand into shear-induced voids. Finally, mechanical properties of the kiln-dried LD OPW pre-compressed at a 0.45 strain without collapse-induced voids are comparable to those that have been air-dried. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",

  "abstract": "The underlying mechanisms of drying collapse in liquid-filled oil palm wood (OPW) have been explored. By systematically varying the liquid surface tension inside the OPW, different degrees of drying collapse commonly observed throughout the whole trunk were shown to be initiated at identical threshold capillary pressure. Microstructural examination confirmed that despite having different sizes and wall thicknesses, the thin-wall parenchyma cells possess a roughly constant wall thickness-to-radius ratio to resist buckling. The equivalent behavior of drying collapse and mechanical collapse under compression of saturated OPW was demonstrated to prove that the drying collapse is controlled by the flow of liquid through the wood. Less collapse corresponds to the lower permeability of the liquid through the wood cells. Variation in the post-collapse behavior is a result of the initiation and termination of the liquid flow inside the interconnected parenchyma cell cavities through small pit openings of plasmodesmata of various distributions. This new understanding provides insight into the drying collapse mechanism of the liquid-filled partially closed-cell foam of a similar structure. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

In addition, the reuse of the plant-cushioning material with and without tangerine oil for two, three, or four transportation and storage cycles was investigated. The results demonstrated that the plant-cushioning material with tangerine oil protected the Kluai Hom Thong banana from mould growth by 100% and it reduced the bruised areas on the banana peel by 80%. The tangerine oil vapour released from the plant-cushioning material might also affect the ripening of the banana, since the colour changed from green to yellow more quickly in the fruit that had been treated with tangerine oil compared to the control fruit. In addition, this intelligent cushioning material containing tangerine oil has great potential in reducing bruised areas, inhibiting mould and extending the quality of the banana during transportation and storage (14 days) for at least one time compared to the control (5 to 7 days). The reuse of the plant-cushioning material, at least up to four times with and without tangerine oil for the protection of the banana, showed great potential. © 2022, North Carolina State University.

  "abstract": "Dried fish exports generate massive revenue. These exports are in highest demand in the world market. However, dried fish can quickly become spoiled by mould. This creates foul odours that may affect consumer acceptance. Dried fish requires natural antimicrobial agents to improve shelf life. This study aimed to control mould growth and improve the organoleptic properties of dried fish using Litsea cubeba oil vapour in combination with wood smoke. In addition, to understand consumer acceptability, the treated dried fish was used to test consumer brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG). The participants who were able to eat dried fish preferred smoked food and had no history of allergies to dried fish, and essential oils were selected for this test. The combined treatment of the L. cubeba oil vapour at ≥60 μL and smoke for 30 s completely controlled the growth of A. niger at least 6 Log10 CFU g−1 and extended the shelf life of dried fish to 7 days at 30 ± 2 °C compared with the control (3 days). The panellists preferred the dried fish treated with the combined treatment more than the untreated fish (P < 0.05). The consumption (smelling, eating and swallowing) of the treated fish by the participants increased the alpha wave activity in their brains to increase the activation of the neural circuits for attention, working memory, active stage and sensory-motor integration. These findings can be helpful for smoke-dried fish product development and dried fish preservation. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).",

  "abstract": "Asymmetrical internal stress profile within the kiln-dried lumber assessed using the restoring force technique on the half-split specimen has been investigated. Unlike the symmetrical internal stress profile in which the measured restoring force is completely described by an elastic beam theory, the asymmetrical internal stress profile also induces a so-called remnant force. By using the released strain and the elastic modulus data across the entire thickness obtained from the McMillen slice test, a numerical result based on the finite element model successfully simulates the restoring force profile for an entire range of both symmetric and asymmetric stress profiles. The finite element model is leveraged to evaluate the effect of asymmetry of stress profile on the remnant force. The value of the remnant force linearly depends on the stress profile deviation which is inferred to the level of asymmetric stress profile. (Received in July 2022, accepted in September 2022.

  "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of tangerine oil (TO) at 25, 50 and 75 µL mixed with banana flavour (BF) at 25, 50 and 75 µL to protect the quality and enhance the flavour of bananas. Then, 25 µL TO + BF 50 µL were selected for studying the quality of bananas stored at 13 °C ± 2 °C for 7 days, and was used to test consumer brain responses using an electroencephalography (EEG). Results showed that mould grew and decomposition occurred in 10 and 50% of the 25 µL TO + 50 µL BF mixture and control, respectively, after 7 days. Furthermore, this ratio increased ripening by having higher L*, b*, firmness and total soluble solid than the control (p < 0.05), whereas titratable acidity and pH were maintained (p > 0.05). The EEG demonstrated that consumption of TO-treated banana could increase brain alertness using stimulating the beta wave activity on banana stimulations for human brain. Limonene, one of the main components of TO, was found in the flesh of treated banana after storage for 4 weeks and possibly interacted with other components to improve antifungal activity and brain response. © 2021, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).",

  "abstract": "Internal stress (IS) development in juvenile and mature rubberwood during drying has been studied using an online measurement of a restoring force (RF) required to restrain a half-split rectangular wood specimen. According to an abrupt change in the restoring force rate, the evolution of IS can be divided into four distinct regimes, i.e., (i) zero IS, (ii) accelerating IS, (iii) reversing IS and (iv) decelerating IS. In stage I, the wood moisture content (MC) is still above fiber saturation point (FSP) with no drying shrinkage. In stage II, the negative RF constantly accelerates. IS mainly develops due to drying shrinkage with the activation energy of 19 kJ/mol. In stage III, the negative RF sharply decelerates and later reverses to the positive value. This regime takes place as the dried zone moves inwards and ends when there is no wet zone left. The stress reversal phenomenon having the activation energy of 36 kJ/mol contains two negative maxima, which occur faster in mature wood than in juvenile wood. Possible creep relaxation due to shear deformation of hemicellulose/lignin matrix between the cellulose fibrils is discussed. Finally, the positive RF decelerates in stage IV with the RF rate gradually declining and remaining at zero up until the end of drying. The corresponding activation energy of stage IV is 52 kJ/mol for both juvenile and mature rubberwood. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

  "abstract": "This research investigated an effective closed system containing orange oil to inhibit important mold growth, delay weight loss, protect salacca color and extend the shelf-life of salacca fruit in 1L box during storage at 28 ± 2 °C for 28 days under different conditions, including open-air, closed system conditions, and closed system conditions containing 1 mL of each an emulsion of orange oil at 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16% ww−1. Sensory evaluation was carried out using the 9-point hedonic scale. The action mechanism of storage systems on salacca preservation was investigated in terms of limonene, gas composition, ethylene content, and pigments revealing salacca color were examined. The results indicated the closed system containing orange oil at 0.08% was the most effective compared to the open-air system and control closed system without orange oil. Orange oil could inhibit mold growth on salacca, delay weight loss, maintain redness of salacca fruit with high sensory acceptance (color, flavor, and taste) and delay senescence. The closed system with orange oil could extend the salacca shelf life from 10 days (control open air) to at least 28 days. The mode of action's key main factor was that the closed system offered higher CO2 and lower O2 contents required to maintain pigments related to salacca color in the salacca skin. Limonene was the main factor delaying the growth of mold during storage in a closed system. Consequently, to extend the saleable period of salacca at ambient temperature, the application of a closed system containing orange oil at an optimum ratio is an alternative approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "The objective of this work was to study the effect of carnauba wax containing orange oil on physical qualities (weight loss, color, and firmness) and sensory perception after consumption. First, the appropriate essential oil for use with salacca fruit was investigated. Then, the best pairing of carnauba wax and orange oil was employed to study salacca preservation. Carnauba wax (2.5%) containing orange oil at a concentration of 0.04–0.16% was coated on salacca and examined for weight loss, color and firmness after storage for 9 d. Sensory perception in terms of sensory acceptance, rejection threshold and prevalent attributes related to aroma profiles was evaluated. The human brain response during salacca consumption was examined by electroencephalography (EEG). The results illustrated that salacca treated with carnauba wax containing orange oil at a concentration of 0.08% could maintain the desired qualities and provide moderate organoleptic approval of salacca. In addition, EEG demonstrated that consumption of orange oil-treated salacca could increase the alertness state of brain function in the human response. This finding can be used to apply orange oil to salacca fruit to enhance flavor, which was shown to achieve better consumer approval based on human brain activity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "In this study, cross-laminated timber (CLT) was manufactured from rubberwood via hot pressing. The effects of manufacturing parameters, such as resin content and clamping pressure, on the following properties of CLT panels were investigated: density (ρ), water absorption (WA), thickness swelling (TS), bonding strength (BS), compressive strength in the major strength direction of CLT (σmajor), compressive strength in the direction perpendicular to the flat plane of CLT (σFlat)), and rolling shear strength (RS). The relationships among the properties of the CLT panel, those the original rubberwood material, and the manufacturing parameters was also explored. The results showed that the resin content and clamping pressure did not significantly affect most of the examined properties of the CLT panels. The ρ, WA, σmajor, σFlat, and RS of the panels could be estimated directly from the properties of the original rubberwood, while the TS could be estimated directly from the clamping pressure applied on the panel. However, no such relationship was found for the BS value. Compared with typical softwood-CLT, the rubberwood-CLT exhibited superior mechanical properties. This implies that CLT made of rubberwood can achieve better structural performance than standard CLT can. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

This study investigated the use of peppermint oil as an alternative method to inhibit surface mould and prolong the shelf-life of dragon fruit during storage. Peppermint oil adsorbed activated carbon at different concentrations (100–1000 μL L−1) was placed with the dragon fruit in the storage box (1 L) at 25 ± 2 °C and 75 ± 5%RH for 21 days. The effect of peppermint oil adsorbed activated carbon on antifungal activity and quality of dragon fruit were evaluated. It was found that peppermint oil adsorbed activated carbon at 700 μL L−1 could provide 100% inhibition of surface mould and decay fungi for more than 14 days of storage (control start decayed at day 7). In addition, essential oil vapour maintained a more firm fruit, greenness of the bract, titratable acid value and total phenolic content after 21 days in comparison to the control. The possible mode of action was demonstrated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to involve the release of menthol from peppermint oil activated carbon, which then interacts with other compounds to exhibit antifungal activity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "Abstract: The aim of the study was to control the release of peppermint oil (700 µL/L) by coating activated carbon (AC) contained in sachets with different solutions (tapioca starch, corn starch, gelatine, carnauba, paraffin, and mixed carnauba–paraffin) for inhibiting the growth of Aspergillus flavus on brown rice (BR). Paraffin-coated AC with adsorbed peppermint oil was then applied to extend the shelf life of BR during long-term storage (60 days) at 30 ± 2 °C. The mechanism of peppermint oil vapor release in this system was also studied using GC–MS. The result revealed that paraffin-coated AC with adsorbed peppermint oil present in sachets showed the highest antifungal activity against A. flavus growing on the surface of BR. In addition, paraffin-coated AC with adsorbed peppermint oil could prolong the shelf life of BR from 10 days (control) to at least 60 days under tropical climatic conditions. Moreover, storage of BR in the presence of sachets containing paraffin-coated AC with adsorbed peppermint oil at a concentration of 700 µL/L revealed no significant effects on major rice quality-related factors, such as moisture content, color, water uptake percentage, and gelatinization temperature. Peppermint oil component analysis by GC–MS indicated that paraffin could trap some minor components of peppermint oil and allow the major components such as menthone, menthol, and alpha-pinene, which are compounds that play an important role in mold growth inhibition, to be exposed to air. Thus, this research demonstrated the potential of paraffin-coated AC containing adsorbed peppermint oil for controlling the growth of molds during prolonged rice storage. Practical Application: Paraffin-coated activated carbon with adsorbed peppermint oil has the potential to be commercially applied to brown rice grains for facilitating long-term storage. This technique is beneficial for avoiding the occurrence of negative sensorial factors when peppermint oil vapors are used. This process is interesting and easy to apply during large-scale implementation of a rice storage system. Published 2019.

The small size three-layer CLT panels were manufactured using melamine urea formaldehyde adhesive as bonding between the lumber layers. Effects of oil palm wood density and the controlled strain levels of the panel during pressing on the properties of the obtained CLT panels were investigated. Panel thickness (Pt), density (ρ), water absorption (WA), thickness swelling (TS), bonding strength (BS), compressive strength (F                             c0                             ) and modulus (E                             c0                             ) parallel to the major strength direction, compressive strength (F                             c90                             ) and modulus (E                             c90                             ) perpendicular to the flat plane and rolling shear strength (RS) of the produced CLT panels were measured. The result showed that oil palm wood density and the controlled strain level had noticeable effect on the properties of the obtained CLT panels. Using high controlled strain level of up to 20.8% and density oil palm wood to produce CLT panels gave better dimensional stability and mechanical properties for the final product but it resulted in an increasing of panel density. Thickness of the produced CLT panels decreased with increasing the controlled strain level during pressing.

Response surface methodology (RSM) with X                             1                              (concentration of L. cubeba oil at 100, 300, and 500 mg g                             -1                             ), X                             2                              (temperature at 60, 80, and 100 °C), and X                             3                              (time at 12, 14, and 16 h) was used to find the inhibitory periods of natural mold on packaging plates. The physical properties and the change of chemical components on the bamboo packaging plate before and after temperature treatment were determined to find the mode of action using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). High temperature (at 100 °C) was a good inhibitor of all mold growth with the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of 300 mg g                             -1                             ; without heat treatment, no MIC was found. In addition, it was found that by using 300 mg g                             -1                              of L. cubeba oil at 100 °C with an exposure time of 12 h, spore germination on the bamboo surfaces was completely inhibited for at least 290 days. After using high temperature, citral was detected on the surface of the packaging plates. Therefore, these components could be the key factors for inhibiting molds.                          © 2019 North Carolina State University.",

  "abstract": "The introduction of a restoring force technique has allowed the internal stress within kiln-dried lumber to be assessed, without requiring a modulus. However, an analytical model based on the elastic beam theory was only valid within a flexural range and only internal stress in the direction of the width was assumed to exist. Within this work, the model was extended to lumber, which could also contain some other internal stress components, by testing 30-mm-thick and 100-mm- to 130-mm-wide flat-sawn rubberwood boards. The improved model successfully separated the effects of other internal stress components in terms of a remnant force. Also, a finite element analysis was employed to validate the internal stress behavior. With little impact from other internal stress components, the finite element model, which used the released strain and Young's modulus in the tangential direction, successfully simulated the restoring force profile for an entire half-split length, including the relatively short half-split length outside the flexural range. But the finite element model failed to perfectly capture the restoring force behavior in the presence of other internal stress components. Future work is required to fully investigate the internal stress in all three main orthogonal directions. © 2019, North Carolina State University.",

  "abstract": "The aims of this study were to develop absorbent material from a water hyacinth root containing bergamot oil and to improve its antifungal activity by using ultraviolet C (UV-C) against the growth of A. flavus on the brown rice. Process optimization was studied by the immersion of a water hyacinth root into a water and bergamot oil (300, 500 and 700 μl ml−1). The root (absorbent material) was dried at 50, 70, and 90 °C for 10 min. Then, ultraviolet C (UV-C) was used for enhancing the antifungal activity of bergamot oil for 10, 15, and 20 min. The shelf-life of the brown rice with the absorbent after incubation at 25 ° C with 100 % RH for 12 weeks was also investigated. A microscope and a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to find out possible mode of action. Results indicated that the absorbent material produced from the water hyacinth root containing bergamot oil at 500 μl ml−1 in the water solution, dried at 70 ° C and UV for 15 min showed the highest antifungal activity in a vapor phase against A. flavus on the brown rice. A microscopy investigation confirmed that the water hyacinth root could absorb bergamot oil from an outside water solution into root cells. Limonene in vapor phase was shown to be a stronger inhibitor than essential oil after UV-C radiation and should be the key factor in boosting bergamot oil antifungal activity. A vapor phase of bergamot oil could be released and inhibit natural mold on the surface of the brown rice for up to 12 weeks; without the absorbent, mold covered the brown rice in only 4 weeks. © 2016, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).",

  "abstract": "Recently, several types of food packaging have been developed which are able to prolong shelf-life of, and maintain the quality and safety of, products. Many kinds of material have been applied to food packaging, in the forms of film, sachets, or pads, to protect, eliminate, or inhibit undesirable changes in food. Based on the increasing concern about environmental sustainability, there have been many attempts to develop a natural biodegradable food packaging. Activated carbon as a multifunctional material is an interesting alternative choice. Apart from its ability to naturally degrade, non-toxicity, and low cost, it possesses remarkable adsorption potential. Its abilities are versatile, and could be used in various application purposes. Thus, its ability strongly depends on its pore structure and surface chemistry. Although it has been known for its effect on hydrophobic substances, the modification of pore size and surface property of activated carbon could improve its affinity to hydrophilic substances. Two means of activated carbon applications in food packaging were classified, according to its adsorption and releasing ability. The first mean is the application of activated carbon for the emission of antimicrobial agents in the vapor phase and nanoparticles inside food packaging. The second mean is the application of activated carbon for scavenging of factors affecting food quality inside packaging, such as water vapor, oxygen, ethylene, and odor. In this paper, the adsorption-releasing mechanism of activated carbon on some of the antimicrobial agents and vapor phase substances are discussed. Additionally, the potential role of activated carbon in food packaging is summarized. © 2018, Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "For a quantification of internal stress within industrial kiln-dried timber, a comparison of a new restoring force (RF) technique is made against the McMillen slice test and the standard case-hardening test. Simulation of the RF has been performed by using a numerical model of finite element (FE) analysis. 30 mm thick industrial kiln-dried rubberwood timber with 58, 78 and 100 mm widths was used in the study. The measured RFs for each timber size are proportional to the released strain data measured by the McMillan slice test and the gap openings measured according to the case-hardening test. The FE simulated and measured RFs are in good agreement. The geometrical shape factor as functions of timber width and cutting depth ratio is derived so that the internal stress can then be calculated without accounting for the modulus of elasticity. The calculated maximum internal stresses of all the examined timber sizes fall into a single curve and linearly relate to the released strain data. The RF measurement has the potential to be an alternative method to the existing techniques for a reliable and meaningful assessment of drying stress within industrial kiln-dried timber. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",

  "abstract": "Due to difficulties in determining modulus of elasticity of wood, only strain or deflection profiles caused by relaxation of internal stress are normally evaluated for industrial kiln-dried lumber. To directly assess the level of internal stress within the lumber, a new technique of measuring the restoring force on a half-split specimen has been presented and the corresponding device has been designed and constructed. Kiln-dried rubberwood specimens with dimensions of 30 or 50 mm (thickness), 130 mm (width) and 50 mm (length) were used in the study. The measured restoring force appears to vary with half-split length and specimen thickness. A mathematical model based on an elastic cantilever beam theory has been successfully developed to describe the restoring force behavior in a flexural response regime. The magnitude of the maximum linearly averaged internal stress σm can be derived without prior knowledge of the modulus of elasticity of wood. For the 30-mm-thick lumber, the derived values of σm are in general agreement with the ones obtained from the conventional McMillen slice test. Very close agreement is observed when the internal stress is at a relatively low level and its profile is approximately linear. But for the 50-mm-thick lumber, the determination of σm is less appropriate because of its relatively short flexural range. A restoring force–internal stress chart has been proposed for practical use in the lumber industry. This assessment was performed to investigate the evolution of internal stress during the conditioning and storage stages of kiln-dried rubberwood lumber. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

  "abstract": "The generation of drying stress within the lumber from the trunk of a rubber tree prepared from different locations (radial distance up to 110 mm and height up to 4 m) has been investigated in real-time by using a restoring force measurement on half-split specimens. Drying was performed at constant dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures of 90 and 60 °C, respectively. The entire restoring force profiles do not vary significantly with height. In addition, before and after the reversal of stress, the force profiles are largely similar and the maximum negative and positive forces are approximately equal regardless of wood locations within the tree trunk. However in the radial direction, the process of stress reversal consisting of two negative force maxima appears to proceed slower in the inner juvenile wood than in the outer mature wood. Upon water immersion of the specimens for 4 months, the second negative force maximum gradually disappears and the force profiles with a shorter stress reversal period become less sensitive to the wood locations. An examination of the drying curves in the second stage of drying during stress reversal also indicates a slower migration of bound water out of the lumber in the juvenile wood compared to that in the mature wood. The drying is also faster in the water-immersed specimens. It is concluded that variability of the internal stress within the trunk of a rubber tree originated from the role of cell wall amorphous constituents and cell wall extractives on creep property and the movement of bound water within the wood cell wall during drying. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

  "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of essential oil (Michelia alba) vapor on the spore germination and mycelium growth of Aspergillus flavus on brown rice and to perceive the shelf life of the brown rice could be extended to a longer storage time. Different volumes (150, 300, 450 μl) of M. alba and a 300 μl linalool/caryophyllene combination at ratios of 10:1, 1:1, and 1:10 were first absorbed into plant absorbent material (Φ∼20 mm) before being put into a closed glass box (1L) containing A. flavus spore and the mycelium (Φ∼5 mm) in a Malt Extract Agar (uncovered plate). Mold testing was also carried out on brown rice with A. flavus spore suspension before being incubated at 25° C and 100% RH for 16 weeks. Quality tests e.g. texture, a sensorial evaluation (hedonic scale) of brown rice were also conducted. Results indicated that the vapor phase of M. alba at ≥ 300 μl L−1 air could inhibit both spore germination and A. flavus mycelium. Antifungal activity of M. alba in air was strongly correlated with the linalool/caryophyllene combination at the ratio of 10:1 in 300 μl L−1 air. In addition, M. alba vapor at 300 μl L−1 air was found to extend the shelf-life of the brown rice by four times (16 weeks) in comparison with the control treated without essential oil (4 weeks). After being cooked, the hardness of brown rice with volatile essential oil was found to be reduced by one third (compared to the control brown rice). The hedonic value (overall liking) of cooked brown rice packed with M. alba vapor at 300 μl for 1 week and then stored for 16 weeks was a 7, rated as “like moderately”. Therefore, this study has demonstrated the good potential of M. alba vapor to control mold growth on the surface of brown rice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "The objective of this research is to evaluate the antifungal activity of michelia oil (Michelia alba) and its main components (linalool and caryophyllene) at concentrations of 300–500 mg g−1against the growth of Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Fusarium sp. and Cladosporium sp. on the surface of bamboo paper packaging boxes. Next, Helium-Neon (He-Ne) laser operating at 543, 594, 604, 612, and 633 nm for 1 min was used to enhance the antifungal activity of these additives. A spore suspension of each mold (7log10 CFU ml−1) was inoculated on pieces of treated bamboo paper. Visible mycelium growth of all molds on treated bamboo paper compared to control specimens was to calculate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The inhibitory period of michelia oil and linalool in a bamboo paper box with and without laser against natural mold infections on brown rice snack bars was further examined for 8 weeks at 25 °C and 100% RH. The MIC values of michelia oil and linalool with laser treatment were 300 mg g−1 and 150 mg g−1, respectively. Without laser treatment, no MICs were found at the maximum concentration (500 mg g−1). Therefore, linalool was shown to be a stronger inhibitor than the essential oil after laser treatment and should be the key factor in boosting the antifungal activity of michelia oil. In addition, the MICs showed the capability of bamboo paper boxes treated with michelia oil and linalool, with laser treatment to protect against mold growth on snack bars for at least 5–7 weeks in comparison with the control (3 days) during storage at accelerated conditions (25 °C and 100% RH). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to improve the antifungal activity of the volatile Litsea cubeba essential oil and its main components (citral and limonene) on brown rice snack bars by applying He-Ne laser treatment. Different volumes (50-200μL) of L. cubeba, citral or limonene were absorbed into a filter paper and placed inside an oven (18L). Ten brown rice snack bars (2cm wide×4cm long×0.5cm deep) were put in an oven and heated at 180°C for 20min. The shelf-life of the treated snack bars at 30°C was assessed and sensory testing was carried out to investigate their consumer acceptability. A count of total phenolic content (TPC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on the properties of essential oil, citral, and limonene before and after the laser treatment was studied for possible modes of action. It was found that the laser treatment improved the antifungal activity of the examined volatile L. cubeba and citral with Aspergillus flavus inhibition by 80% in comparison with those of the control not treated with the laser. L. cubeba vapor at 100μL with the laser treatment was found to completely inhibit the growth of natural molds on the snack bars for at least 25days; however, without essential oil vapor and laser treatment, naturally contaminating mold was observed in 3days. Results from the sensory tests showed that the panelists were unable to detect flavor and aroma differences between essential oil treatment and the control. Laser treatment caused an increase in TPC of citral oil whereas the TPC in limonene showed a decrease after the laser treatment. These situations could result from the changing peak of the aliphatic hydrocarbons that was revealed by the FTIR spectra. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents a study of the bending's stiffness and strength of oil palm wood (OPW) core sandwich panel overlaid with rubberwood veneer under center point bending. Parameters including density and grain orientation of OPW core, rubberwood veneer thickness and span length were investigated. An experimental evaluation of some mechanical properties of OPW and the bending stiffness and strength of the sandwich beams was performed. Linear elastic beam theory was used to predict the bending performance of the panels. Results show that the linear elastic beam theory with the uses of the power law expressions of Young's moduli and shear strength of the OPW as a function of density derived within this study, adequately predicted the stiffness and bending strength of the sandwich beams. Higher OPW core density increased stiffness and strength of the beam. Failures by face fracture and core shear were observed which the latter tended to occur at low OPW core density, relatively thick veneer face and short span length. Grain orientation of OPW core little influenced stiffness and strength of the sandwich board. Finally, the stiffness and failure load equations of the OPW sandwich board were proposed for practical uses of this product. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",

Effect of the treatment on some important physical and mechanical properties of particleboards was also examined. Dip treatment in cinnamon oil and clove oil at a concentration of 0.63 % was capable of providing complete protection for at least 8 and 5 weeks, respectively, against growth of the test molds on particleboards at 25 °C and 100 % RH. Treatment had no significant effect on physical and mechanical properties of the particleboards. Contents of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol in the particleboards, the main antifungal agents in cinnamon oil and clove oil, respectively, largely declined within the first 4 weeks of incubation.

In order to protect rubberwood particleboards against moulds (Aspergillus sp. and Trichothecium sp.) and fungi (Gloeophylum sp. and Trametes sp.), application of essential oil (cinnamon or clove oil) as an antifungal agent was investigated. A solution of each essential oil in ethanol was sprayed onto rubberwood particles during a glue-particle blending process to achieve various concentrations of 0 to 3% (by mass of dried particles). Chemical compounds of essential oil deposited in the finished board after hot processing were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Besides mould and decay resistance, physical and mechanical properties of the particleboards were examined. Cinnamaldehyde (1.8 μg g-1) and eugenol (5.2 μg g-1) were detected in boards treated with 3% cinnamon oil and clove oil respectively. A complete protection against growth of Aspergillus sp. and Trichothecium sp. on the boards was extended from less than 1 week till 9 weeks at 25 ° C and 100% relative humidity. Percentage mass loss caused by Trametes sp. and Gloeophylum sp. was also reduced to 5%. Essential oil treatment reduced equilibrium moisture content and thickness swelling without affecting water absorption and bending properties of particleboards. Internal bond strength of particleboards remained unaffected by addition of cinnamon oil and clove oil up to 1.8%, above which a slight reduction was observed. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia",

  "abstract": "This study observed the antifungal activity of crude coffee extract (CCE) and crude spent coffee ground extract (CSCGE) against Aspergillus, Penicillum and Eurotium on the surface of an areca palm leaf sheath (Areca catechu). The extraction of CCE and CSCGE could be performed twice to obtain extracts containing aromatic compounds such as caffeine capable of inhibiting mould growth on an areca palm leaf sheath.This study observed the antifungal activity of crude coffee extract (CCE) and crude spent coffee ground extract (CSCGE) against Aspergillus sp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillum citrinum, Penicillum chrysogenum and Eurotium amstelodami on the surface of an areca palm leaf sheath (Areca catechu). The agar dilution method was employed to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the CCE for the first, second and third extractions and CSCGE for the first and second extractions in malt extract agar at concentrations from 50 to 500 μg/ml. A mould test was then performed on durian paste product wrapped with the areca palm leaf sheath treated with the second CSCGE at its MIC. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed to find the major components of the CCE and CSCGE and to measure the total phenolic content. For the second CSCGE treatment on the areca palm leaf sheath, the following qualities were studied: mould growth, wettability, measurements of hardness and thickness and a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scan. It was found that the CCE and CSCGE MICs from the first and second extractions ranged from 100 to 230 μg/ml and from 300 to 460 μg/ml, respectively. In addition, the MICs showed the capability of CCE and CSCGE to provide protection against mould growth on the leaf sheath for at least 21 days in comparison with the control (3 days) during storage at accelerated conditions (25 C and 100% relative humidity). Shelf life of durian paste product wrapped with areca palm leaf sheath treated with the second CSCGE at 460 μg/ml was extended from 3 days to 21 days under storage condition of 30 C. Caffeine was the main constituent of CCE (79.69%) and CSCGE (84.92%). Also, the total phenolic content of CCE and CSCGE measured were 0.640 and 0.981 mol ferulic acid 100 g-1, respectively. This study has demonstrated that the first and second CCE and CSCGE were capable of inhibiting mould growth under both in vitro and in vivo tests.  Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Bamboo utilization is restricted by its tubular culm. An attempt was made to understand flattening mechanisms of a half-tubular bamboo culm in hot linseed oil. The half tubular culm of Dendrocalamus asper Backer was pressed into a flatter shape under a constantly applied load while being softened in hot linseed oil. Specimen height, used to calculate the degree of flatness, was recorded as a function of time. Effects of linseed oil temperature (80–180 °C) and properties of bamboo specimens, i.e. initial moisture content (0–46 %), volume fraction of vascular bundles (35–55 %) and thickness (3–5 mm), on the flattening behavior were examined. The presence of moisture in bamboo reduced the temperature at which deformation began and increased the final board flatness. Higher volume fraction of vascular bundles reduced the rate of deformation. Linseed oil temperature of at least 120 °C was required to achieve good quality flat boards and to avoid immediate springback after load removal. Flattening of relatively thick bamboo specimens was limited as a result of non-uniform softening throughout the specimen thickness. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Changes in the microbial quality (total yeast and mould), physical quality (colour and hardness), nutritional value, mineral content and trace element content of a brown rice snack bar before and after treatment (130 W for 30 min) were also studied. Low pressure RF plasma at 130 W for 30 min inhibited A. flavus on a brown rice snack bar the best. Plasma treatment at these conditions provided a 4 log CFU·g-1 reduction of yeast and mould and kept the snack bar at an acceptable quality. Low pressure RF plasma did not affect the brown rice snack bar colour (L* a* b*), hardness quality, crude protein, fibre or ash (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in sodium, potassium, zinc, manganese and selenium (p > 0.05). However, the contents of crude fat, calcium, magnesium and copper were significantly higher than before treatment (p < 0.05). These results suggest that low pressure RF plasma can be effectively used as an alternative method for snack bar sterilization. © 2013 VÚP Food Research Institute, Bratislava.",

  "abstract": "An attempt to control the growth of Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp., commonly found on the surface of the areca palm (Areca catechu) leaf sheath, by using clove oil and its main components (eugenol, linalool, and caryophyllene) at concentrations of 5-100μlml-1 both invitro (agar dilution method) and invivo (dip method) was enhanced by discharging cold atmospheric plasma at 40W for 10min. The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clove oil and eugenol was reduced tenfold against all molds at concentrations of 10μlml-1 and 5μlml-1, respectively, after cold atmospheric plasma treatment. For the in-vivo assays, clove oil at 30μlml-1 and eugenol at 10μlml-1with cold atmospheric plasma could extend the protection against the growth of all molds on the surface of an areca palm leaf sheath from 14 days (control) to at least 12wk at 25°C. In addition, it was observed that eugenol was the main agent responsible for the antifungal activity of clove oil after plasma treatment. This study has demonstrated the good potential of using atmospheric plasma treatment to enhance antifungal activity of clove oil and to control molds on an areca palm leaf sheath. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Low-density sandwich panels consisting of an oil palm wood core overlaid with a rubberwood veneer face were manufactured. Effects of two types of grain orientation of the oil palm wood core (parallel and perpendicular to board surface) and three different veneer thicknesses (0.7, 1.8 and 2.7 mm) and core densities (223 ± 14, 301 ± 35 and 418 ± 33 kg/m 3) on some physical and mechanical properties of the boards were investigated. Results showed that higher core density increased the values of thermal conductivity, screw withdrawal resistance, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity but decreased the value of water absorption without effect on thickness swelling of the boards. Boards with the core grain direction oriented perpendicular to panel's surface possessed lower value of thickness swelling but higher values of thermal conductivity and strain at fracture when the board failed in a mode of core shear under bending test than those of the others. Finally, the relationship between board density and the measured physical and mechanical properties of the oil palm wood core sandwich panels overlaid with a rubberwood veneer expressed as mathematical equations could be used to predict and design the expected properties of this type of sandwich board. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Physical and mechanical properties of the sandwich panel were investigated and compared with commercial wood-based products. Two manufacturing parameters were examined, i.e. two types of grain orientation of the oil palm wood core (parallel and perpendicular to board surface) and three levels of adhesive melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF) resin content (150, 250 and 350 g m-2 solid basis). Results showed that the sandwich panel made from oil palm wood as core material with rubberwood veneer as facing had better or similar properties compared with commercial products. Core grain orientation had significant effect on various board properties such as thickness swelling, modulus of elasticity and thermal conductivity. On the other hand, level of resin content within the range studied did not influence any property of the boards.

The chemical composition was determined according to official AOAC methods and an inductively coupled plasma-based technique used to analyse the minerals. The results revealed that all of the EBNs examined mainly consisted of protein (61.0-66.9%) with 15.9-31.6. mg/g protein of essential amino acids and carbohydrates (25.4-31.4%). Sulfur-containing essential amino acids (methionine and cysteine) and glutamine were the main amino acid constituents. Major mineral elements detected were sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K). All EBNs appeared to be good sources of Ca and Mg according to the adult dietary reference intake (DRI). The farmed EBNs collected from the Nakhon Si Thammarat and Trat provinces in particular contained sulfur essential amino acids which met the requirement of the reference pattern recommended by FAO/WHO/UNU. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Argon plasma at 40 W was found to be the most effective agent to inhibit the growth of all molds and to reduce spore germination for in vitro test. Furthermore, in vivo assays determined that Ar plasma at 40 W was the most efficient agent against mold spoilage on brown rice cereal. The results indicated that Ar plasma provided good protection against mold on brown rice cereal for at least 19 days under storage conditions at 25°C and 100%RH.

Essential oil constituents left within the rubberwood after the heat curing and after incubation were analyzed by GC-MS. Response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite face-centered (CCF) design was employed to evaluate the time needed for initiation of mold growth. The mathematical models containing only significant parameters (p ≤ 0.05) as functions of treatment temperature and essential oil concentration were obtained. Heat curing adversely and positively influenced the antifungal activities of anise oil and garlic oil, respectively. Such thermal effect was more pronounced at a higher concentration of essential oil. Decomposition of trans-anethole and estragole in anise oil and formation of diallyl disulfide in garlic oil by heat was proposed as the agent responsible for temperature dependencies of the essential oil antifungal activities observed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

  "abstract": "To understand internal stress (IS) development within lumber during drying of rubberwood, restoring force measurements on half-sawn specimens has been performed at drying temperature of 90 °C under various patterns of wet-bulb (WB) temperature: (1) single-step drying, (2) two-step drying, (3) oscillation drying, and (4) stress control drying. Two extreme single-step drying conditions designated as \" severe\" and \" conservative\" at WB temperatures of 40 °C and 80 °C, respectively, were applied as control drying. It was shown that the measured force, which strongly correlates with the released strain data obtained by the McMillen slice test, indicates the level of IS developed within the lumber. In two-step drying, when the time of abrupt WB temperature change from conservative to severe drying conditions is extended up to the time of stress reversal, the force detected after stress reversal decreases from the level of severe drying to that of conservative drying. Once the time of stress reversal is exceeded, the force profile is largely unaffected by the parameters of the severe drying condition. Gradual reduction in WB temperature beyond the time of peak stress also reduces the force detected later after stress reversal under severe drying conditions. Oscillation of the WB temperature between conservative and severe conditions periodically changes the magnitude of the measured force. After stress reversal, the force amplitude monotonically decreases after each drying cycle. In addition, longer oscillation cycles seem to produce larger initial force amplitudes, which decline quicker than those created under the shorter ones. The possible application of the measured force as a controlling parameter of rubberwood drying has also been demonstrated. Copyright © by Walter de Gruyter.",

  "abstract": "Aims: This study aimed to examine heat curing effect (30-100°C) on antifungal activities of lime oil and its components (limonene, p-cymene, β-pinene and α-pinene) at concentrations ranging from 100 to 300 μl ml-1 against Aspergillus niger in microbiological medium and to optimize heat curing of lime oil for efficient mould control on sedge (Lepironia articulata). Methods and Results: Broth dilution method was employed to determine lime oil minimum inhibitory concentration, which was at 90 μl ml-1 with heat curing at 70°C. Limonene, a main component of lime oil, was an agent responsible for temperature dependencies of lime oil activities observed. Response surface methodology was used to construct the mathematical model describing a time period of zero mould growth on sedge as functions of heat curing temperature and lime oil concentration. Heat curing of 90 μl ml-1 lime oil at 70°C extended a period of zero mould growth on sedge to 18 weeks under moist conditions. Conclusions: Heat curing at 70°C best enhanced antifungal activity of lime oil against A. niger both in medium and on sedge. Significance and Impact of the Study: Heat curing of lime oil has potential to be used to enhance the antifungal safety of sedge products. © 2013 The Society for Applied Microbiology.",

  "abstract": "Magnetic properties of composites prepared by coating lacquer containing neodymium iron boron (Nd-Fe-B) powders on rubberwood were characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), magnetic moment measurements, and attraction tests with an iron-core solenoid. The Nd-Fe-B powders were recycled from electronic wastes by the ball-milling technique. Varying the milling time from 20 to 300 min, the magnetic squareness and the coercive field of the Nd-Fe-B powders were at the minimum when the powders were milled for 130 min. It followed that the coercive field of the magnetic wood composites was increased with the milling time increasing from 130 to 300 min. For the magnetic wood composites using Nd-Fe-B obtained from the same milling time, the magnetic squareness and the coercive field were rather insensitive to the variation of Nd-Fe-B concentration in coating lacquer from 0.43 to 1.00 g/cm3. By contrast, the magnetization and magnetic moment were increased with the Nd-Fe-B concentration increasing. Furthermore, the electrical current in the solenoid required for the attraction of the magnetic wood composites was exponentially reduced with the increase in the amount of Nd-Fe-B used in the coating. © 2013 University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Response surface methodology (RSM) with a two-factor, four level (42) full factorial was employed. The mathematical models describing those properties as functions of treatment temperature and logarithm of treatment time were obtained. Hydrothermal treatment adversely and positively influenced mechanical properties (TS and SS) and durability (FML and TAS), respectively, of rubberwood. Strong correlations between ΔE*, TS, SS, and FML of hydrothermally treated rubberwood, proposed to be a consequence of degradation of hemicelluloses, were observed. Finally, ΔE* proved to be a good indicator of TS, SS, and FML but not that of EMC and TAS of hydrothermally treated rubberwood.",

An agar dilution method was employed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of essential oils and their main components. Zone inhibition tests and the inhibitory effect of the leaf sheath dip-treated with essential oils against those molds were examined. Major components of essential oils on the leaf sheath during storage were quantified by gas chromatography analysis. The MIC values of essential oils on agar and on the leaf sheath were identical. With an MIC of 50μgml-1, cinnamon oil had the strongest inhibitory effect. At their MICs the oils were capable of providing protection against mold growth on the leaf sheath for at least 12 weeks during storage at 25°C and 100% RH. Scanning electron microscope examination showed that essential oils prevented spore germination. Except for menthol in peppermint oil, the main components of the essential oils, which were fairly stable over the storage period, largely contributed to the antifungal activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

  "abstract": "In an attempt to develop a real-time measurement technique for an internal stress perpendicular to grain in the radial direction of rubberwood lumber during drying and conditioning, a novel design of a force measuring device, consisting of a restrained half-sawn specimen and a restrained free shrinkage specimen, was constructed. The measured force was verified with a differential released strain obtained from the conventional McMillen slice technique. The device was then employed to investigate the internal stress evolution during drying and conditioning of rubberwood lumber. It was shown that the force measured using the device strongly correlates with the differential released strain. The extents of the internal stress characteristics such as the maximum tensile and compressive forces and the reciprocal of time at stress reversal obey the Arrhenius equation and the adapted equation of sorption for the temperature and humidity dependences, respectively. The results also indicate that cooling under relatively high humidity after drying improves the internal stress relaxation process during conditioning. Possible application of the technique in kiln drying of rubberwood has been demonstrated. The measured force could be used as controlling parameter for an adaptive wood drying control system taking into account real-time material response of wood during drying and conditioning. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",

  "abstract": "Antimicrobial activities of extracts from the edible bird's nest (EBN) against four food borne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albican, and Aspergillus niger) were investigated. The EBN extracts were prepared using two methods: a soaking extraction method in ethyl acetate or methanol at 100-3,000 mg/L and a solvent extraction method in ethyl acetate or methanol at 20-100 mg/L. The agar well diffusion method was employed to examine antimicrobial activity of each EBN extract at various concentrations. For the soaking extraction method using methanol, the EBN extract showed stronger antimicrobial activity for S.aureus (100 mg/L) and C. albican (100 mg/L) than for E.coli (1,000 mg/L) and A. niger (>3,000 mg/L) while the EBN extract derived by the soaking extraction in ethyl acetate showed no inhibitory effects. Results of the solvent extraction method showed that the EBN extracts using ethyl acetate were more effective than using methanol with C. albican (20 mg/L) and A. niger (20 mg/L). However, using methanol showed some activity with S. aureus at 20-100 mg/L. Using the solvent extraction method with methanol showed slight effects with E. coli (>100 mg/L). This study has demonstrated a potential of the EBN extract as an antimicrobial agent against food borne pathogens.",

Seven small-scale short columns (125 mm × 125 mm × 600 mm) with different type of reinforcements were tested under concentric loading to investigate strength capacity and ductility. The results showed that the strength capacity of short columns reinforced by bamboo without surface treatment could resist the axial load as structurally required by ACI318-05, but ductility was rather low especially the column that was reinforced by 1.6 percent of reinforcing bamboo which showed brittle behavior similar to that of plain concrete column. This was thought to be an effect of water absorption and a loss of bonding strength between concrete and bamboo. On the other hand, columns reinforced by bamboo treated with water-repellent substance, Sikadur-31CFN, showed higher strength and ductility than columns reinforced by untreated bamboo. The result also showed that 1.6% of steel reinforcement, in relation to the column crosssection, could be replaced by 3.2% of treated reinforcing bamboo, for similar behavior, strength and ductility.",

The broth dilution method and the agar diffusion technique were employed to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) using the concentration of substances between 100 and 800 μl ml-1. Inhibitory effects of essential oils and their main components at the MICs against mold growth, fungal decay, and termite attack on rubberwood were further examined by means of the dip treatment method. It was found that MFC values against molds for all treatments examined were about 50-100 μl ml-1 higher than MIC values. Peppermint oil and menthol exhibited high fungistatic and fungicidal activities, with MICs of 300 μl ml-1 and 350 μl ml-1, respectively, against the test molds and the decay fungus. Eucalyptus oil and eucalyptol were also effective against these microbes but at higher concentrations of 600 μl ml-1 and 500 μl ml-1, respectively. Only peppermint oil at the MIC was capable of providing a complete protection from mold growth on rubberwood for up to 12 weeks at storage conditions of 25 °C and 100% RH.

  "abstract": "Lumber drying is the most energy and time consuming process within the rubberwood lumber industry. The aim of this study was to develop an effective drying schedule for rubberwood lumber by accelerating the moisture movement out of lumber without degrading the lumber during drying. The study explored the effect of dry bulb temperature (60°C, 75°C and 90°C), steaming at the beginning of drying, predrying of lumber prior to drying, and top loading of lumber on the drying characteristics and lumber quality (bow, crook, twist, end splitting and color) of 30mm thick rubberwood lumber under the target EMC at 4% and air velocity of 4m/s. Accelerated conventional temperature drying of lumber at 90°C reduced the drying time by -50% from 117 hours to 54 hours but increased the energy consumption by 22% with respect to the conventional temperature drying at 60°C. The average activation energy for drying was 26 kJ/mol. Drying temperature had very little effect on quality of lumber after drying (bow, crook, twist, end splitting and color). Steaming at the beginning of drying and predrying of lumber prior to drying reduced and increased the percentage of end splitting, respectively. A top load of about 300 kg/m 2 slightly decreased twist. Drying at higher temperatures produced more casehardening within the lumber but conditioning at higher temperatures was more effective in releasing the residual stress generated by drying. After conditioning at high temperatures prong of less than 0.5° casehardening was obtained.",

  "abstract": "A coupled thermodynamic/kinetic model for diffusional processes in superalloys is described. Use is made of the generalised force-flux equations, and therefore an accurate knowledge of thermodynamical properties of the system is a prerequisite for the calculations. Calculations can be carried out in either the lattice-fixed (Kirkendall) or the mass-invariant (Matano) frame. In order to model transformations, e.g. involving the γ and γ′ phases, the concept of an interface sub-system is introduced. The numerical accuracy and stability associated with the treatment of the moving boundary is shown to be comparable to more traditional analyses which incorporate the Murray-Landis transformation. The results from the simulations are compared with experimental information, which includes (i) concentration profiles, (ii) movement of inert markers and (iii) observations of porosity formation. Particular attention is paid to the simulation of Ni-Al-Cr interdiffusion in the f.c.c. phase, for which reliable thermodynamic and kinetic information is available. Similar comparisons have been made for precipitation reactions involving the γ′ phase, although the available information is very sparse. Observations made on a number of Ni-Ni3(Al,Ti) couples can be simulated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Particular advantages of the method are (i) the interface between phases is treated in a novel way, which avoids numerical difficulties arising from the estimation of concentration gradients at phase boundaries, (ii) it can be readily extended to multicomponent systems, and (iii) the treatment of the Kirkendall drift of vacancies. It is clear that there is a great need for experimentation aimed at deducing kinetic data, e.g. diffusional mobilities, particularly for the γ′ phase. © 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

At 950 °C, tertiary creep was prevalent while little primary creep exhibited under the stress level tested. The extent of the creep as a function of misorientation away from 〈001〉 was rationalized with a model which takes account of the underlying deformation mechanisms.

  "abstract": "The creep performance of 〈001〉-orientated CMSX-4 superalloy single crystals at temperatures beyond 1000°C is analysed. Rafting of the γ′ structure occurs rapidly, e.g. for the 1150°C/100 MPa tests rafting is completed within the first 10 h. At this stage and for a considerable time thereafter the creep strain rate decreases with increasing strain, implying a creep hardening effect which is absent at lower temperatures when the kinetics of rafting is less rapid. Once a critical strain ε* of (0.7 ± 0.3)% is reached, the creep strain increases dramatically and failure occurs within a few tens of hours. It is demonstrated that methods of interpretation which, assume a proportionality between the creep strain rate and creep strain, are unable to account for creep hardening which occurs as a consequence of rafting. A modification is proposed which accounts for the blocking of the glide/climb of {111} 〈11̄0〉 creep dislocations which occurs as the number of vertical γ channels is reduced and cellular dislocation networks become stabilized. Consequently, failure must be taken to be associated with creep cavitation, which occurs predominantly around casting porosity. It is emphasized that more work is required to quantify the interaction between the various creep damage mechanisms.",

  "abstract": "The structure of the a[removed] dislocation ribbons in CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy crept at 750°C and 750 MPa has been characterised using transmission electron microscopy. Calculations are performed which confirm that the macroscopic creep deformation occurring under these conditions, i.e. the accumulation of primary creep, is principally a result of the movement of the ribbons through the γ/γ′ structure. Emphasis is placed on clarifying the factors which control the movement of the fault: It appears that the rate controlling step is the entry of the final a/3[removed] dislocation into the γ′ phase, which has the effect of removing the superlattice extrinsic fault. Further observations suggest that the a/2[removed] dislocation play a vital role not only in nucleating the ribbons, but also in terminating their long-range movement through the microstructure. It is proposed that this latter effect results in the breakdown of primary creep and thus the transition to secondary 'steady-state' creep. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "The effect of orientation on the primary-creep mechanism of the Ni-based single-crystal superalloy CMSX-4 is examined. Four specimens with orientations within 20 deg of the [001] axis are deformed at 750 °C and 750 MPa and show a decreasing amount of primary creep as the tensile axis approaches the [001]-[011] symmetry boundary. Of these, specimen N lies within 1 deg of [013] and shows a negligible primary creep and a very low secondary creep rate. For this specimen, direct observation in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and analysis of the shape change show that 〈112〉{111}, stacking-fault shear, is absent. Analysis of the dislocations present in the gamma precipitates and at the γ/γ′ interface shows that the only dislocations present have the Burgers vectors a/2[101] and a/2[10-1], which cannot combine to nucleate the dislocations necessary for stacking-fault shear. Thus, it is argued that the reason for the low degree of primary creep for orientations close to the [001]-[011] symmetry boundary is not the interaction between two equally stressed 〈112〉{111} systems, but the lack of either. As the orientation moves away from the [001]-[011] boundary, the range of dislocation Burgers vectors increases and stacking-fault shear is nucleated; the amount of primary creep increases as a consequence.",

  "abstract": "The kinetics of γ rafting in CMSX-4 single crystals at 950°C has been studied using scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The crept material was subjected to further heat treatment in the absence of applied stress, in order to deduce the threshold strain εth for rafting to continue; this is shown to be 0.10 ± 0.03%. For strains smaller than εth, rafting occurs exceedingly slowly; once εth is exceeded the kinetics are largely unaffected by the absence of applied stress. The magnitude of εth confers a reduction in γ/γ′ interfacial coherency and a relaxation of interfacial misfit stresses. It is concluded that the threshold strain is a quantity suitable for distinguishing between rafting occurring in the 'elastic' and 'plastic' regimes. The results confirm conclusively that plasticization of the horizontal γ-channels by (a/2)〈11̄0〉{111} creep dislocations and their subsequent adsorption at the γ/γ′ interfaces, with a concomitant loss of perfect coherency and reduction in elastic misfit strains, is responsible for providing the kinetic path which enables rafting to occur at a reasonable speed. An argument is put forward to explain the magnitude of εth.",

  "abstract": "Kiln drying of rubberwood lumbers is a complex transport phenomenon for realistic modeling and simulation. To decouple this complexity, researchers usually divide their research into two parts. The first one is single-lumber drying kinetics to describe how wood lumber responds to its surface conditions. Then they combine this drying kinetics with a lumped transport model or dispersion model or computational fluid dynamics. The mathematical models are then solved numerically to predict the industrial kiln drying behaviors. This work focuses on the drying kinetics of stacked rubberwood lumbers using hot air at different air velocity (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0 m/s), relative humidity (6–67% relative humidity (RH)) and temperature (60–100 °C). The drying kinetics followed the conventional drying theory. However, the two drying periods, namely constant and falling rate (CRP and FRP), were not distinct. As the air velocity increased, the transition from CRP to FRP is faster. The middle of the transition period (at critical moisture content, CMC) moves closer to the fiber saturation point (FSP). The overall mass transfer coefficients in the falling rate period for stacked rubberwood drying were lower than those predicted by the Ananias correlation. Hence, a modified formula was proposed, representing the overall moisture transfer coefficients as a function of air velocity, temperature, relative humidity, and lumbers thickness for the range of variables under investigation satisfactorily. In general, the drying rate and the overall moisture transfer coefficient increased with increasing air velocity, drying temperature, and decreasing RH. Relative humidity directly affects the driving force of moisture transfer rate because higher RH is associated with higher equilibrium moisture content. A lumped parameter model for kiln drying was also developed. After being integrated with the estimated mass transfer coefficient, the model can predict the moisture profiles in lab-scale kiln drying satisfactory, although the model needs more validation data. These kinetic parameters and correlation for stacked rubberwood drying can be used in more complex models and process optimization in future research. © 2020 The Author(s)Mechanical Engineering; Thermodynamics; kiln drying, drying kinetics, energy cost saving, mass transfer coefficient, rubber wood lumbers. © 2020 The Author(s)",

  "abstract": "To assess the residual drying stress within industrial kiln-dried lumber, produced with a variety of sizes and shapes of rectangular cross section, interpretation of the restoring force profile obtained from the restrained half-split wood specimen is described. The finite element (FE) model was employed to simulate the restoring force profile of the half-split specimens having different sizes (thickness, 30–80 mm) and different shapes of rectangular cross section (width-to-thickness, w:d, ratio, 2.0–4.0). The analytical model based on the Timoshenko beam theory has been developed to describe the FE-simulated restoring force profiles. An agreement is found at relatively long half-split length of the very wide specimens (w:d ≥ 4). To describe the entire restoring force profile with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the modified stress decay function near free edges has been incorporated and the corresponding parameters have been determined. The size-independent parameters appear to linearly vary with the shape ratio (w:d). The analytical equation and shape-dependent parameters have been successfully employed to directly deduce (without a knowledge of the modulus data) the average maximum internal stress existing within the kiln-dried rubberwood lumber of various sizes and shapes. The derived magnitudes of the average maximum internal stress are in reasonable agreement with those obtained from the conventional McMillen slice technique. This magnitude of the internal stress could be used as a stress indicator for quality control of the commercial kiln-dried lumber in the sawmill industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "Computer science; Epileptic abnormalities identification; Deep neural networks; EEG signals. © 2020 The Author(s)An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures and records the electrical activity of the brain. It provides valuable information that can be used to identify epileptic abnormalities. However, the visual identification of such abnormalities from EEG signals by expert neurologists is time consuming. Therefore, several researchers have proposed using deep neural networks (DNNs) to automate the identification of these abnormalities. Their studies have examined the use of different numbers of layers, different numbers of parameters, and various operation types arranged in different architectures. This paper presents the shallowest 11-layer DNN architecture capable of classifying three classes of EEG signals: normal, preictal, and seizure. When the proposed architecture was applied to the standard University of Bonn EEG signal dataset, it achieved accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity values of 99.43%, 99.57%, and 99.10%, respectively. It not only had a better performance than the state of the art DNN architectures, but also had shallower layers with fewer parameters. This allowed it to more quickly identify epileptic abnormalities. Experiments were also conducted where the length of the EEG signals was reduced to 65% (2,662 samples with a period of 15.26 s), which in turn minimised the total parameters of the proposed architecture so that it was comparable to the smallest state-of-the-art architecture and decreased the lag time for identification. Even in these experiments, it was capable of producing equal performance measures, with the execution time reduced to only 69% of that when employing the full length of EEG signals. © 2020 The Author(s)",

  "abstract": "Real-time object detection is an expected application of deep neural networks (DNNs). It can be achieved by employing graphic processing units (GPUs) or dedicated hardware accelerators. Alternatively, in this work, we present a software scheme to accelerate the inference stage of DNNs designed for object detection. The scheme relies on partial processing within the consecutive convolution layers of a DNN. It makes use of different relationships between the locations of the components of an input feature, an intermediate feature representation, and an output feature to effectively identify the modified components. This downsizes the matrix multiplicand to cover only those modified components. Therefore, matrix multiplication is accelerated within a convolution layer. In addition, the aforementioned relationships can also be employed to signal the next consecutive convolution layer regarding the modified components. This further helps reduce the overhead of the comparison on a member-by-member basis to identify the modified components. The proposed scheme has been experimentally benchmarked against a similar concept approach, namely, CBinfer, and against the original Darknet on the Tiny-You Only Look Once network. The experiments were conducted on a personal computer with dual CPU running at 3.5 GHz without GPU acceleration upon video data sets from YouTube. The results show that improvement ratios of 1.56 and 13.10 in terms of detection frame rate over CBinfer and Darknet, respectively, are attainable on average. Our scheme was also extended to exploit GPU-assisted acceleration. The experimental results of NVIDIA Jetson TX2 reached a detection frame rate of 28.12 frames per second (1.25× with respect to CBinfer). The accuracy of detection of all experiments was preserved at 90% of the original Darknet. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

  "abstract": "A deep learning-based object detector has been successfully applied to all application areas. It has high immunity to variations in illumination and deviations among objects. One weakness of the detector is that it requires a huge, undefinable dataset for training the detector to avoid overtraining and make it deployable. This research proposes a framework to create a deep learning-based object detector with a limited-sized dataset. The framework is based on training the detector with the regions surrounding an object that typically contain various features over a more extensive area than the object itself. Our proposed algorithm further post-processes the detection results to identify the object. The framework is applied to the problem of wood pith approximation. The YOLO v3 framework was employed to create the detector with all default hyperparameters based on the transfer learning approach. A wood pith dataset with only 150 images is used to create the detector with a ratio between training to testing of 90:10. Several experiments were performed to compare the detection results from different approaches to preparing the regions surrounding a pith, i.e., all regions, only close neighbors, and only diagonal neighbors around a pith. The best experiment result shows that the framework outperforms the typical approach to create the detector with approximately twice the detection precision at a relative average error. © 2023 by the authors.

  "abstract": "Sawmills in Thailand demand an automatic approach to correctly detect rubberwood pith. This is a starting point to maximize the yield of slabs. Knowing the pith location at both end faces of a log makes it possible for a log scaler to turn the log to align both piths parallel to a bandsaw. Then, the likely to defect part, the knot, can be removed. The rest of the log is then cut to produce a set of slabs. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to accelerate estimating the pith location of rubberwood with lower estimation error from the untreated cross section image captured by a normal camera. The algorithm employs the histogram of oriented gradients and a set of relevant histogram bin indices to reduce the number of line segments to be successively used in a computational intensive group of line intersection part of the algorithm. The results confirm that the execution time of the proposed algorithm is 187 times and the estimation correctness is 2.69 times compared to the formerly proposed method for European species on a set of 35 cross section rubberwood images taken from a realistic sawmill environment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

  "abstract": "YOLO (You-Only-Look-Once) is by far the well-known Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) object detection algorithm with real-time performance on a computer with GPUs. Conceptually, YOLO divides the input image of size into non-overlapping square cells with the final feature of size  i.e. Each cell is responsible for predicting a single object whose centre falls into it. In this paper, we propose the algorithm that makes use of our observation mapping relationship which states that while the sizes of square cells are changed from layer to layer, their indices are preserved. The algorithm operates by locating a region of change in an input image and identifies the indices of square cells that cover the region. Only the members of the input features within these cells in all layers along the network are required to be operated. When the algorithm is employed along with the spatio-temporal property within video frames, it is capable of attaining the best relative detection of 1.47 (about 7Â fps) with 90% correctness.

Evaluating the risk of falling is important because it enables the provision of adapted assistance and of taking preventive measures with subjects deemed at risk of falling. Currently, the risk of falling has been evaluated by using questionnaires with their associated problems of subjectivity and limited accuracy in recall. The Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) has found applicability in a wide range of application areas. Our research as a whole has a final objective to employ the concept SOM to implement an adaptive fall risk detection and warning system. In this paper, we present the preliminary results from our research to utilize SOM to analyze the motion parameters from a miniature sensor with integrated gyroscopes and accelerometers attached to the chest of an individual. The results clearly indicate that SOM can be successfully used to cluster the activities by means of their motion parameters.

  "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) attempts to classify performed activities from data retrieved from different sensors attached to the body. Most publications pertaining to HAR based on deep neural networks (DNNs) report the development of a suitable architecture to improve recognition accuracy by increasing the parameters of the architecture. Our work follows a different approach by attempting to optimise DNN-based HAR by reducing the dimensions of acceleration data, by finding a suitable sample size for processing by the DNN and by reducing the parameters of the proposed architecture. The experiments rely on employing two previously presented DNN-based HAR architectures as the baselines and starting points to create our candidate architectures. The variations in the dimensions of acceleration data, i.e., {xy, yz, xz, x, y, z}, and the sample size, i.e. {4, 6, 8} s duration, to these candidate architectures are experimented to produce the winner architecture which takes the shortest sample size and the minimal dimensions of acceleration data while preserving the recognition precision. The results indicate that despite the number of parameters is approximately half of the baseline architecture with two dimensions of acceleration data and shorter sample size (i.e., using a sample of 4 s duration instead of 8 s and only the xy axes of acceleration data), the resulting DNN-based HAR classifiers can produce comparable or better recognition precision than the baseline classifiers. The experimental results were obtained using three different popular datasets: the WISDM, the UCI HAR, and the Real World 2016. The proposed classifiers with optimised settings are useful as they require less processing time and reduce power consumption, both in terms of retrieving acceleration data from the sensor and the CPU processing time. Furthermore, they reduce the memory requirements for parameter storing and are suitable for incorporation in a wearable device. © 2021 The Author(s)",

There have been many attempts to automate pith detection in images taken by a normal camera. The objective of this study is to comparatively study the effectiveness of two popular deep neural network (DNN) object detection algorithms for parawood pith detection in cross-sectional wood images. In the experiment, a database of 345 cross-sectional images of parawood, taken by a normal camera within a sawmill environment, was quadrupled in size via image augmentation. The images were then manually annotated to label the pith regions. The dataset was used to train two DNN object detection algorithms, an SSD (single shot detector) MobileNet and you-only-look-once (YOLO), via transfer learning. The inference results, utilizing pretrained models obtained by minimizing a loss function in both algorithms, were obtained on a separate dataset of 215 images and compared. The detection rate and average location error with respect to the ground truth were used to evaluate the effectiveness of detection. Additionally, the average distance error results were compared with the results of a state-of-the-art non-DNN algorithm. SSD MobileNet obtained the best detection rate of 87.7% with a ratio of training to test data of 80:20 and 152,000 training iterations. The average distance error of SSD MobileNet is comparable to that of YOLO and six times better than that of the non-DNN algorithm. Hence, SSD MobileNet is an effective approach to automating parawood pith detection in cross-sectional images. © 2020 The Author(s)",

  "abstract": "Parts of a self-organizing map (SOM)-based quantizer can be performed in parallel, i.e., distance calculation between an input pixel and a group of codewords or processing elements (PEs), and updating codewords. To search for the best matching unit (BMU) whose distance is the minimum, all distances are inevitably required to compare with each other. It is true that a group of comparators and registers can be instantiated with equal size to the distances (which is equivalent to the number of PEs) and performed in a multistage manner to come up with the minimum distance and its index. In this way, the algorithm requires n = log2C clock cycles, where C is the number of PEs and ∑k=0n-12k are the number of comparators and registers. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware centric algorithm with the objective to accelerate the BMU searching stage of the SOM-based quantizer. In a simple form, the algorithm relies on using a PE’s distance as an address of a memory to store its index. Simultaneously with storing indices of all PEs, the states of all ‘non-empty’ addresses within the memory are prepared. In this way, it can be stated that the position of the first non-empty state corresponds to the memory address whose content is the BMU index. The approach to find the first position of the non-empty state within a single clock cycle is also detailed. The algorithm is also adapted to make it more feasible to realize on an FPGA platform. The synthesis results compared with the conventional BMU searching indicate that the FPGA resource requirements of the algorithm are 1.8 and 1.57 times in terms of slices and LUT usages, respectively. In terms of acceleration, the algorithm outperforms the conventional ones by a factor of 1.8 for a test image of size 512 × 512 pixels. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

  "abstract": "The Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (K-SOM) has found applicability in a wide range of application areas. It has also proved to be successfully used in compressing digital images. The dominant point of the algorithm is that it is more suitable to realise in hardware platforms in order to speed up the overall operation. It, however, comes in exchange with the drawback of poorer resulting image quality compared to software implementation. This comes from the fact that both a codebook and a learning kernel within the hardware platform need to be approximated by an integer basis in order to limit the hardware utilization and speed up the execution time. In addition, the learning kernel which has a substantial impact on the quantized image quality is required to be a simple linear integer-based function. In this paper, we propose a hardware centric K-SOM quantizer algorithm which relies on a rational-based representation of the codebook and learning kernel. This extends the capability of the quantizer to accept an approximated non-linear learning kernel. The experimental results have proved that the quality of the outcome images is superior to predecessor implementations with an acceptable throughput and FPGA resource utilizations. The results show that the image quality, measured by the mean square error (MSE), has an average improvement ratio of 0.68 compared to the state-of-the-art integer representation K-SOM quantizer with respect to the standard test images while the proposed quantizer takes only 9% more of the FPGA resources. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

  "abstract": "In order to produce a high quality rubberwood fingerjoint with highly uniform colour, wood boards of naturally different shades and colours are required to be elaborately classified and grouped. Within each group, wood boards of comparable shade and colour are then cut and joined to form a highly uniform shade and colour fingerjoint of the required dimensions. Currently, many manufacturers in Thailand still rely heavily on a manual classification process by an expert. In this paper, an automatic approach based on a combination of an image processing technique and an artificial neural network is presented. The Kohonen self organizing map (SOM) is selected and used for training with modified histogram data from the hue colour component of the rubberwood boards' images. The outcome SOM is then used to classify an unknown colour rubberwood board with a novel colour group identification algorithm. The overall approach has proved effective in classifying the unknown colour of boards with as high as 95% accuracy without human intervention. In many cases, the approach provides invaluable information to guide an operator to easily classify the remaining 5%. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Sawmills rely on locating wood pith at the end surface of a wood stem either to automate the process and maximize the yield or to perform wood quality assessment of wood planks. Previously, wood pith location was approximated by applying image processing algorithms along with some geometric relations between the annual rings within a cross-sectional image of wood and its pith. This produces failed detection results if the wood stems deviate from a circular shape. In this paper, we propose employing YOLO (you only look once) object detection to a wood pith identification problem. The Tiny-YOLO network with 23 layers was trained using a transfer learning approach with 345 wood cross-sectional images with pith annotations. Different experiments with variable ratios between the training and testing datasets and training iterations were carried out to produce checkpoints and test against the testing datasets. We found that the minimum loss function which is commonly used to indicate the best trained model in other deep neural networks (DNNs) object detection is not effective for this application. Therefore, we used detection accuracy, to reflect the percentage of detectable piths while inferencing the trained model with its testing dataset and an average distance error, i.e., the average distances between the detected piths and their ground truths, as the accuracy measurement. The experimental result shows that a ratio of training and testing datasets of 70:30, at training iterations of 170,000, gives rise to the maximum detection value of 76.3% with a 16.6-pixel average distance error. Additionally, it produces only 25% average distance error; \\frac{1034}{4176} with 50% standard deviation; \\frac{2533}{5395}, compared to the state of the art non-DNN-based pith detection approach. © 2019 IEEE.",

  "abstract": "Eye-tracking technology has many useful applications, including Virtual Reality (VR) devices, Augmented Reality (AR) devices, and assistive technology. The main objective of eye-tracking technology is to detect eye position and track eye movements. It is possible to determine the eye position when the pupil center is detected. In this paper, a deep learning-based approach to the detection of pupil centers from webcam images is presented. As opposed to all previous approaches to object detection based on training the detector with objects to be detected, our object detector was trained with both the region surrounding a pupil and the region between an eye and the region surrounding a pupil. The latter set of regions has been found to increase the overall detection accuracy. A novel post-processing algorithm is also presented to estimate the pupil center from all the detected regions. To achieve real-time performance, we have adopted the tiny architecture of YOLOv3, which has 23 layers and can be executed without requiring a GPU accelerator. To train the detectors, different variations of regions covering a pupil and an eye were used, as well as expanding regions surrounding a pupil and an eye. The PUPPIE dataset was used as the primary input for training the detector. The setting with the best detection accuracy was applied to all publicly available datasets: I2Head, MPIIGaze, and U2Eyes. In terms of accuracy, the results indicate that pupil center estimation is comparable to the state-of-the-art approach. It achieves pupil center estimation errors below the size of a constricted pupil in more than 98.24% of images. Furthermore, the detection time is 2.8 times faster than the state-of-the-art approach. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.",

  "abstract": "A K-SOM quantizer and its hardware implementation requires a considerable amount of processing time during the learning stage. This results from the fact that a queried pixel which is taken from an input image needs to be tested with all codewords in the codebook. This is done in order to find and update the codeword whose distance is the shortest; i.e. the best matching unit (BMU). The processes are iteratively performed until either all pixels are processed or a quantization error is acceptable. During the learning stage, the learning rate is gradually adjusted to condense the codebook to represent an input image. Several approaches have been proposed to accelerate the processing time during the learning stage ranging from a simple pixel sub-sampling approach to an approach to accelerate the BMU finding process. In this paper, we present a novel approach to terminate the learning stage when the mean square error (MSE) is acceptable. A fast mean square error calculation involving selecting and subsampling pixels is incorporated into the algorithm. The experimental results confirm that the approach outperforms the state-of-the-art hardware K-SOM quantizer in terms of execution time and MSE. This comes in exchange with an additional resources utilization of around 30% on a field programmable gate array platform. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

  "abstract": "Parts of a SOM (Self-Organizing Map) based quantizer can be performed in parallel; i.e. distance calculation between an input pixel and a group of codewords or processing elements (PEs), and updating weight of PEs. To search for the best matching unit (BMU) whose distance is the minimum, all distances are inevitably required to compare with each other. Conventionally, the minimum distance searching unit is constructed from a group of comparators which are connected in a multistage manner in order to come up with the final single minimum distance and its index. In this way, the overall latency of the unit is linearly proportional to the number of stage of comparators log2(C) where C is the number of distances. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware centric algorithm with the objective to reduce the latency for the minimum distance searching unit. In a simple form, the algorithm relies on using a memory of K addresses of 1-bit word size where K is equal to the maximum value of distance. During operation, all distances are used to refer to the memory addresses in order to change their states from 'unoccupied' to 'occupied'. To efficiently search for the first address whose state is 'occupied', which is equivalent to the minimum distance, the look up table is employed. The algorithm is also adapted to make it more feasible to realize on an FPGA platform. The synthesis results compared with the conventional minimum distance searching indicate that the FPGA resource requirements of the algorithm are twice in terms of slices and LUT usages. In term of latency reduction, the implementation takes only 0.62 times of the conventional one for a PE size of 256. After integrating the unit to the SOM based quantizer, it has found that the obtained frame rate is 1.50 times of the conventional one for a PE size of 256, the image size of 512x512 and the clock speed of 66.67 MHz. The latency reduction can be further improved if the FPGA supports combining all the 'occupied' states in a single stage in contrast to use a group of internal limited input size LUTs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, electric field lines are obtained by drawing lines perpendicular to these equipotential lines. These experimental procedures take time and are prone to errors when performed in a student laboratory. To integrate computers and microcontroller systems with physics experiments, we have developed a prototype 'automatic sampling system'. The system consists of a microcontroller and its peripherals to control mechanical parts which move the probe to locations within the sampling area, read potential values from those locations and send them back to a computer for analysis. The system together with a computer program can be effectively used to experimentally study an electric field mapping in different configurations of electrodes.",

The main drawback of this technique is that it is a very computationally intensive task if software implementation is performed alone. Fortunately, the structure is fairly easy to convert into parallel processing units. However, it consumes much of a microchip's internal resources and results in utilizing more than a single microchip to realize the structure in pure hardware. Previously proposed K-SOM realizations were mainly targeted on implementing on an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) with low restriction on resource utilization. In this paper, we, in contrast, propose a novel architecture of K-SOM which compromises between image quality, frame rate throughput and FPGA's resource utilization.

  "abstract": "Kohonen self-organizing map (K-SOM) has proved to be suitable for lossy compression of digital images. The major drawback of the software implementation of this technique is its very computational intensive task. Fortunately, the structure is fairly easy to convert into hardware processing units executing in parallel. The resulting hardware system, however, consumes much of a microchip's internal resources, i.e. slice registers and look-up table units. This results in utilising more than a single microchip to realize the structure in pure hardware implementation. Previously proposed K-SOM realizations were mainly targetted on implementing on an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with low restriction on resource utilization. In this paper, we propose an alternative architecture of K-SOM suitable for moderate density FPGAs with acceptable image quality and frame rate. In addition, its hardware architecture and synthesis results are presented. The proposed K-SOM algorithm compromises between the image quality, the frame rate throughput, the FPGA's resource utilization and, additionally, the topological relationship among neural cells within the network. The architecture has been proved to be successfully synthesized on a single moderate resource FPGA with acceptable image quality and frame rate. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "This study investigated coral and reef fish recovery following the COVID-19 event between low and high environmental disturbance reefs at Racha Yai Island, Southern Thailand. Three and four 50-m permanent line transects were set at low and high environmental reefs to collect the percent of live coral cover, fish diversity and abundance, and fish trophic-functional groups based on diet and habitat use. Our results showed a significant rise in the percentage of live coral cover, the number of individual fish, the number of fish species, and species richness at both bays following the COVID-19 lockdown due to a crucial reduction in human activities on the reef. In addition, there were increases in the number of corallivore fishes belonging to Chaetodontidae and Pomacentridae families and a reduction of omnivorous fish at the fish-feeding tourist attraction reefs due during the COVID-19 lockdown due to reducing fish-feeding tourism. This indicated that restricted human activities and reduced anthropogenic stress on a coral reef may have substantial short-term impacts on reef fish diversity. Our insights could help designate guidelines to manage tourist impacts on coral reefs and aid in their prolonged persistence. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee C.E.J, Tehran, Iran.",

  "abstract": "Aim: Seed predation and dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents are important for plant population dynamics and forest structure. In this study, the potential of red spiny rats (Maxomys surifer) as predators, dispersers and scatter-hoarders of Parah (Elateriospermum tapos) seeds was examined in Khao Nan National Park, Thailand. Methodology: One thousand Parah seeds and 100 rats were used in this experiment. Ten seeds with one rat were set inside a cage. Infrared videos of seed predation and dispersal by the rats were made from 9:00-10:00 p.m. afterwards, the numbers of seeds predated (predated, undamaged, and partially predated), dispersed (non-removed, displaced and removed) and scatter-hoarded were recorded. Results: The percentage of undamaged, predated and partially predated seeds, as well as of removed, non-removed, and displaced seeds differed significantly. In both males and females, most of the seeds were undamaged, followed by those predated and partially predated. Additionally, most of the seeds were not removed, followed by those removed and displaced. Both males (35%) and females (37%) scatter-hoarded seeds, and the seed numbers did not differ between sexes. Body weight of rats was positively correlated with the percentage of predated seeds and negatively correlated with the percentage of undamaged seeds, but not with the potentially viable, non-removed, displaced, or removed seeds. Interpretation: Red spiny rats act as predators, dispersers and scatter-hoarders of Parah seeds. It indicates that these rats may play an important role in Parah population dynamics. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).",

  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in climatic factors and fruit quality between on-and off-season production periods. Climate, soil, and mangosteen measurements were all studied during on-and off-season production. We chose 40 mangosteen trees and observed flowering and fruit set rates over two production periods. The results showed that the number of flowers per branch, the number of fruits per branch, the circumference of fruits, and the fruit weight were higher during the on-season mangosteen production period than during the off-season mangosteen production period. However, the number of edible pulp segments, peel thickness, percentage of translucent flesh, and fruit gumminess were lower in the on-season mangosteen production period than in the off-season mangosteen production period. The percentage of fruit scars did not differ between the on-and off-season mangosteen production periods. When compared to the on-season mangosteen production period, there was lower relative humidity, soil moisture at 120 cm depth, and leaf wetness at 15 cm above ground during the off-season mangosteen production period; however, there was higher air temperature, soil moisture, and soil temperature at all four depth levels. © 2023 by the authors.

  "abstract": "We tested for the first time how Austruca bengali Crane, 1975 signaller males adjusted their waving rates based on receiver female body sizes and their distances. We video recorded the waving display of 46 males (9-12 mm carapace width) for 30 s, and counted their waving rate. Receiver females were categorised as small (8-10 mm carapace width) and large (>10 mm). Distances between males and females were categorised as short (≤12 cm) and long (>12 cm) distances. Our results indicate that males are able to measure distances and female sizes, and adjust their waving display by actively reducing waving rate (1) towards small females, as usually small females have lower fecundity compared to large ones and (2) towards females at very close distance because at this point, the females would make their mating decision, and thus males start to lead/hit the females towards their burrow rather than waving vigorously. © 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

  "abstract": "The annual cycles of tropical and subtropical precipitation were estimated by parameterizing them using the inferential circular statistics approach. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) version 7 dataset which has spatial coverage from 50°S to 50°N and temporal coverage from 1998 to 2018 (21 years) was used to compute the monthly precipitation climatology data. Their annual cycles can be estimated using the bimodal von Mises distribution. The estimated parameters were found to sufficiently capture some interesting characteristics such as the non-uniformity and bimodality of precipitation rate associated with regions of convergence zones and subtropical highs. The difference in timings of maximum and minimum precipitation suggest that precipitation maxima over the continent were found to follow the position of the Sun at an average time lag of 1.2 months. Three examples of applying these parameters are given including the regional classification of precipitation which emphasizes on the bimodality the non-uniformity and the bimodality of their annual cycles, the evolution of the southern Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the Pacific Ocean which was found to propagate westward from 90°W in mid-March to 150°W in early-April at an estimated speed of 21.6 km/h, and the precipitation variability in the case of Paris in France in which the precipitation anomaly tend to decrease at a highly significant rate of −9.716 mm/month per decade (p value ≤0.01). © 2020, Korean Meteorological Society and Springer Nature B.V.",

Burrow and soil temperatures were measured using temperature sensors and burrow characteristics were recorded. Both sexes built I- and J-shaped burrows. Female burrows were longer and deeper than male burrows, since female burrows act as breeding burrows in this species. J-shaped burrows were longer and slightly deeper than I-shaped ones. During the day, the burrow temperature was lower than the soil temperature; however, during the night, the opposite result was observed. The burrow length/depth was negatively correlated with the burrow temperature during the day, but these correlations were positive during the night. This study shows that the burrow characteristics of T. rosea modulate the inside temperature of the burrows, maintaining a suitable temperature for the crabs.  © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020.",

This method quantifies astronomical variations by using decomposed vertical tidal acceleration to reconstruct and predict deep-ocean tide. The results show that each decomposed vertical tidal acceleration can be associated with the decomposed sea level having at least 5 astronomical variations. Their associated energies can also be used to diagnose the change of the oceanic tide response to tidal acceleration. Performance evaluation also shows that this method can give comparable reconstruction accuracy and slightly better prediction accuracy compared to the harmonic analysis-based method. It is indicated that the proposed method is accurate enough to be applied in a tsunami detection algorithm. The results also indicate that the proposed method is stable enough to provide unpropagated prediction residuals. © 2021, Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

This study aimed to (1) assess coral recovery at reefs around Racha Yai Island after the 2010 mass coral bleaching event and (2) compare the fish community indices (Shannon diversity, evenness) and fish trophic functional groups between low (Patok Bay) and high (Khonkae Bay) environmental disturbance sites during 2013-2019. The fish surveys and the percent live cora covers from both bays during 2013-2019 were collected using the fish visual census method and a permanent quadrat method along 50-m transect lines. Our results showed that the percentage of live coral cover at both bays increased by 6 8%. At Khonkae Bay, there were 69 reef fish species and 10,684 individual fish belonging to 5 orders, with 27 families and 54 genera observed from 7 orders: Perciformes (91.03%), Tetraodontiformes (5.54%), Syngnathiformes (1.24%) Beloniformes (0.26%), Beryciformes (1.25%), Scorpaeniformes (0.70%), and Aulopiformes (0.06%). Fish community indices at Khonkae Bay increased during 2013-2019 and were composed of species richness (3.65-10.53), the Shannon index (0.65 3.49), and species evenness (0.49-0.91). At Patok Bay, there were 60 reef fish species and 10,362 individual fish belonging to 3 orders, with 22 families and 50 genera observed from 4 orders: Perciformes (93.04%), Tetraodontiformes (5.92%), Syngnathiformes (0.55%), and Anguilliformes (0.53%). Fish community indices at Patok Bay increased during 2014-2019 and were composed of species richness (4.69-8.62), the Shannon index (1.36-3.30), and species evenness (4.92-8.62).

We tested two main hypotheses on the spatial and temporal coexistence of mosquito larvae: (1) condition-specific competition and (2) spatial variation among the five subdistricts. We compared the number of positive houses, positive containers, mosquito coexistence during both the wet and dry seasons. The results showed that from a total of 1,072 positive containers collected in both seasons, Ae. albopictus larvae were found in the highest number of containers (745 containers), followed by containers with Ae. aegypti larvae (283 containers) and containers with Culex larvae (254 containers). During the wet season, there were higher numbers of positive houses, positive containers, and containers with only Ae. albopictus larvae than during the dry season. On the other hand, during the dry season when the water containers were very scarce, there were higher numbers of containers with Culex larvae, and containers held more than one type of mosquito larvae. This indicates that both temporal and spatial variations may contribute to the local coexistence of Aedes and Culex mosquito larvae species in Lansaka District areas in Thailand. © 2020 Malque Publishing.

  "abstract": "Aim: Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are an important aspect of forests and forest use in many parts of the world. The present study aims at examining how local communities have changed their ways of NTFP utilization in the Parah forest after Khao Nan National Park was designated as a national park in the year 2009. Methodology: A questionnaire survey was conducted using 150 randomly selected households from four villages bordering the Parah forest, Khao Nan National Park. The questionnaires were divided into two categories: socio-economics and NTFP utilization. The socio-economics of the interviewees were composed of gender, age group, marital status, education level, number of members/household, principle occupation and level of income. Income was categorized into three income categories, which ranged from poor ([removed]500 $/month), based on the Thailand minimum daily wage. NTFP utilization composed of type of NTFP, harvested quantity and harvesting frequency. Results: NTFPs from the Parah forest were used by 74.67 % of villagers. No differences in the amount of all NTFPs obtained in 2007 and 2015 were found. However, the price of NTFPs has increased over the years, and so the value of NTFPs in the Parah forest in 2015 reached 2,773.36 US Dollars/household, which was much higher than that reported in 2007. The frequency of the NTFPs that were harvested by villagers, ranked from highest to lowest, were as follows: Parah seeds, honey, stink bean fruits (Parkia speciosa), fruits of Archidendron spp., termite mushrooms (Termitomyces spp.), fruits of Parkia javanica, medicinal plants, jiringa fruits (Archidendron jiringa), fruits of Sandoricum koetjape and bamboo shoots. The harvesting quantityofNTFPsdidnotchange after Khao Nan National Park was designated as a National Parkintheyear2009. Interpretation: The existence of a variety of Parah NTFPs are of great importance to the villagers; therefore future planning is needed for conservation and sustainable utilization. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).",

  "abstract": "Investigating the time activity budgets of fiddler crabs is very important to determine the effects of sex and body size on allocating time for different activities. Few previous studies investigated the effects of sex and body size on time allocations in underground mating species. This study determines the effects of sex, size and their interaction on time allocations in a surface mating species (Tubuca rosea (Tweedie, 1937)). The surface activities of large and small, male and female crabs were video recorded. Afterwards time allocations for various activities (e.g., feeding, standing (vigilance), walking, inside burrows, grooming, burrowing, mating, and for males only, fighting and claw-waving) were calculated. All crabs spent most of their time on feeding than on other activities. Smaller crabs spent more time being vigilant, whereas larger crabs spent more time on courtship displays (grooming, and waving), and fighting. Between sexes, females spent more time standing, but less time on walking and grooming than males. Predation risk, reproductive maturation, breeding/non-breeding season, and energy conservation could be important factors for shaping time allocations in T. rosea. © 2019 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido.

We observed I- and J-shaped burrows in both ovigerous and non-ovigerous females, with higher numbers of J-shaped burrows in ovigerous females. However, in non-ovigerous females, I- and J-shaped burrow numbers were not different. Other burrow characteristics had higher values in ovigerous females than in non-ovigerous females. In ovigerous females, I- and J-shaped burrows were not different in diameters, total lengths, total depths, or volumes, but horizontal lengths, ground angles and mid angles were higher in J-shaped burrows.

  "abstract": "Usually, Culex mosquitoes are responsible for spreading several human diseases such as malaria, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, filariasis, and Zika. Lymphatic filariasis and Zika cases are increasing in Thailand with more prevalent in southern Thailand. In this study, our aim is to examine how seasons and water container types affect Culex spp. larvae numbers in Lansaka district, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, southern Thailand. This study was conducted in five sub-districts (Lansaka, Khaokaew, Thadi, Kamlon, and Khunthale) in Lansaka district. In each sub-district, 120 houses were randomly selected to study the breeding sites of Culex mosquito in dry (March-May, 2018) and wet (October-December, 2018) seasons. Mosquito larvae were collected from indoor, outdoor, natural, artificial, dark-coloured, light-coloured, with lid, and without lid containers. It was observed that in all sub-districts, Culex larvae numbers were higher in dry season compared to wet season. In both seasons, outdoor, without lid, dark-coloured, and artificial containers contained more Culex larvae than inside, with lid, light-coloured, and natural containers, respectively. This study shows that seasons and water container types affect Culex mosquito larvae. Since the larvae numbers are higher in dry season, as well as in outdoor, without lid, dark-coloured, and artificial containers, people should reduce the usage of these containers, especially in the dry season, to prevent Culex borne diseases. © 2020 Malque Publishing.

  "abstract": "Parah (Elateriospermum tapos Blume) is a native species of southern Thailand, and is a dominant tree in Khao Nan National Park. There have been few studies of Parah seeds or of seedling establishment. Biotic and abiotic environmental factors interact with seeds and may affect the future of tree populations. This is the first study to determine the factors affecting seeds and seedlings of Parah trees in Khao Nan National Park, Thailand, during 2014 - 2016. We tested 3 factors: (1) parental tree diameter at breast height (DBH), (2) altitude, and (3) distance from the main road. We studied seeds collected from trees, seeds harvested by humans, seed predation, seeds left on the forest floor, and rotten seeds. We measured seed weight, seed size, seedling height, and seedling root collar diameter (RCD). Our results showed that the number of seeds and seedlings per tree, seed weight, seed size, seed harvesting, seed predation, seeds left on the forest floor, rotten seeds, and seedling height varied between the years of study. There was no difference in seeds harvested by humans from 2014 - 2016. The number of seeds per tree and seeds harvested by humans were positively associated with parental tree DBH in 2015 and 2016. The number of seeds left on the forest floor was positively associated with parental tree DBH, and distance from the main road, but was negatively associated with altitude, in 2015, and there was no association in 2016. The number of seeds predated by frugivores was positively associated with altitude in 2016. The number of seedlings per tree was positively associated with distance from the main road. Seedling height was positively associated with distance from the main road, and negatively associated with tree DBH in 2015 and altitude in both years. We found significant results which led to the conclusion that seed production and seeds harvested by humans were positively associated with parental tree size. © 2018, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "The aims of this study are to examine the effects of (1) socio-cultural practices of using different types of water storage containers, and (2) seasons, on the numbers of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus larvae in the five sub-districts of Lansaka district. We randomly selected 20 houses per sub-district per month, with a total of 600 households, and collected Aedes mosquito larvae from different types of containers (indoor/outdoor, natural/artificial, dark/light coloured, and with/without lids) during both the dry (March-May 2015) and wet (October-December 2015) seasons. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae found in each container were identified and counted. The larval indices (i.e., house index (HI), container index (CI), and Breteau index (BI)) were calculated for each sub-district, and for each season. Our results showed that socio-cultural practices of using different types of containers differed between sub-districts and seasons. Ae. albopictus larval indices were higher than Ae. aegypti larval indices in both seasons. Ae. albopictus larval indices were higher in the wet season than in the dry season; the opposite results were observed for Ae. aegypti. Ae. albopictus larvae were more commonly found in outdoor containers in both seasons, but were found to be more in light coloured and without lid containers during the dry season, whereas Ae. aegypti larvae were more often found in indoor containers in both seasons, but are found more in light coloured containers in the dry season. There were positive correlations between container numbers and mosquito larvae numbers in all sub-districts. These results indicate that seasons and water container types have strong effects on the breeding of Aedes mosquito larvae. This knowledge could be used to obtain a better understanding on how to take initiatives that could promote the prevention and control of dengue vectors. © 2018, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

In U. rosea, surface mating is the main mating mode, and females incubate eggs inside their own burrows.We investigated 73 randomly selected burrows with chimneys (36 females, and 37 males). We observed that chimney and burrow characteristics, except for burrow/chimney diameter, were greater in females than in similar-sized males. The burrows were I- A nd J-shaped, with a higher number of J-shaped burrows in females and a higher number of I-shaped burrows in males. J-shaped burrows were longer and deeper, had greater volumes, and had higher and thicker chimneys, than I-shaped burrows. Chimney characteristics were positively correlated with burrow characteristics.

Milne Edwards, 1852). Female burrows were also examined. The results showed that female burrows were smaller than male burrows, with no chamber and, thus, female burrows are not used for breeding; however, 80% of RCM burrows, and 65% of OCM burrows, had chambers. Other characteristics were not different between RCM and OCM burrows, except for maximum width, which was larger in RCM burrows. The waving rates of OCMs and RCMs were not different. Our results indicate that claw regeneration do not have detrimental effects on male waving rate and burrow characteristics. Copyright © 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

  "abstract": "Aim : Studies on oyster population dynamic is essential for effective oyster aquaculture.Bandon Bay in Southern Thailand is a major shellfish aquaculture site of high commercial value. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on oyster diversity and their distribution in Bandon Bay.Methodology : Adult oysters were collected from eight aquaculture sites during low tide and their body sizes were measured. Monthly, transparency, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, alkalinity, ammonium (NH,-N),nitrite, nitrate and phosphate were recorded from Surat Thani Coastal Fisheries Research and Development Centre, Department of Fisheries. Results : Three oyster species were observed: Crassostrea belcheri, Crassostrea lugubris and Saccostrea forskalii, however, C. belcheri was most abundant at most locations. Oyster density in Bandon Bay was mostly influenced by alkalinity, followed by salinity, pH, NO,andNH4-N. Interpretation : Since oyster reproduction, survival and shell development depend on environmental factors, thus studies on relationships between environmental factors and oyster occurrence/density may provide a better understanding about the community structures and spatial dynamics of oysters, as well as how oysters respond to environmental changes. © 2019 Triveni Enterprises.

  "abstract": "We examined the effects of mudballs around burrows and of sex on burrow characteristics (shape, diameter, length, depth and volume) in an underground mating fiddler crab species, Austruca annulipes (H. Milne Edwards, 1837). We investigated 35 burrows with mudballs (males: 20; females: 15) and 34 burrows without mudballs (males: 16; females: 18), and measured their burrow characteristics. Results showed that burrow characteristics did not differ between burrows with and without mudballs. Males built larger-sized burrows with greater volumes, and had more mudballs than females. Crabs built J-, I-, L-, S-and U-shaped burrows, with higher numbers of J-shaped burrows in males, and higher numbers of I-shaped burrows in females. J-shaped burrows were larger with greater volumes, and had more mudballs than I-shaped burrows. For burrows with mudballs, mudball numbers were positively associated with burrow characteristics. This indicates that fiddler crab burrow characteristics are affected by sex, not by the production and presence of mudballs. © 2018 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

Smaller contestants won when body size asymmetries were lesser, but took a longer time to win the contests, while with greater size-Asymmetries, smaller ones lost the contests in a short time. In U.

  "abstract": "Real-time online coral sensor and climatic data are vital for long term ecological observatory research. It is difficult to maintain a continuous real-time online data stream using various underwater sensors feeding to a server. To solve this difficulty, we integrated an event detection and decision support system (DSS) to help researchers to make decisions about sensor maintenance and to proactively prevent system malfunctions. This paper describes the components of pre-processing data in-situ, using behavior learning from historical data, creating anomaly detection, and verifying sensor data. This online system is flexible, for both health monitoring and decision-making. When data loss or sensor malfunctions occur, then an automatic email will be sent to researchers, to show both sensor health and anomaly reports. Researchers will then make a decision on who will fix the problems, and plan for maintenance on site. The integrated decision support system and event detection uses various tools and techniques, such as Mathematica for analysis and open source software (PHP, MySQL, and Highcharts) for visualization. This is the first practical system that uses heterogeneous sensors integrated with flexible cloud storage, which shows both alerts regarding system health and anomaly reports through social media, and helps researchers in decision-making, in order to reduce maintenance time and costs, and to enable long term use of sensor data in order to expand understanding on climate change. © 2016, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "This study explored the spatio-temporal patterns of dengue infection in southern Thailand. Data on monthly-notified cases of dengue fever, over the period of January 1981- May 2014 were collected from the Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health. Weather data over the period of January 2007-May 2014 were obtained from the Thai Meteorological Department. Box and whisker plots were used to study the spatial temporal patterns of dengue incidence. Spearman correlation analysis and time-series adjusted Poisson regression analysis were performed to quantify the relationship between weather and the number of dengue cases. The results show that the highest dengue cases occurred in July in the Gulf of Thailand. Conversely, for the Andaman Sea, the highest dengue cases occurred in June in Phang-Nga, Phuket and Ranong provinces. Only Krabi province had the most dengue cases occurring in July. When we compared dengue transmission duration between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, we found that for the Andaman Sea, Trang province had the longest dengue transmission duration (i.e. June-September) and for the Gulf of Thailand, Nakhon Si Thammarat had the longest dengue transmission duration (i.e. June-September). The number of rainy days and relative humidity were the main predictors of dengue incidence by the Gulf of Thailand, while the amount of rainfall and the temperature were the main predictors of dengue incidence by the Andaman Sea. The time series Poisson regression models provided such goodness-of-fit that the correlation between observed and predicted numbers of dengue incidence exceeded 80%. These models could be used to optimise dengue prevention by predicting trends in dengue incidence. Accurate predictions, for even a few months, provide an invaluable opportunity to mount a vector control intervention or to prepare for hospital demand in the community. © 2016, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

  "abstract": "This study aims to develop a risk score to identify people at high risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the population of Chonburi, Thailand, and to compare this risk score with 2 previous predictive risk scores for T2DM. Data from 7,284 individuals aged ≥ 20 years were collected from the Thai population, using a cross-sectional analytical study method. A screening algorithm was developed based on the first half and validated in the second half of the study population. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for T2DM, by performing a predictive model in which only significant factors were included. Afterwards, our predictive model was compared with the other 2 predictive models, where risk scores were derived from Thai adults. Our results showed that significant predictive variables were age, BMI, hypertension, history of diabetes in parents or siblings, and marital status. A cutoff score of 9 out of 17 produced the optimal sums of sensitivity (74%) and specificity (97%). The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) was 0.969. Our predictive model had a higher AUC when compared to the other 2 models. When the risk score was applied, the predictive model selected 425 subjects who should undergo further testing for diagnosing diabetes and 3,259 subjects who should not. A simple T2DM risk score, based on a set of variables, can be used for the investigation of early intervention to delay or prevent T2DM in Thailand. © 2016 Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "We investigated how male Uca rosea (Tweedie, 1937) have behaviourally or morphologically compensated for having only one functional feeding claw while females have two. We found that male U. rosea used four compensatory mechanisms: (1) larger feeding claws (dactyl length and width), (2) higher feeding rate/claw per min, (3) higher numbers of pinches/feeding claw per min than similar sized females, and (4) higher numbers of pinches/feeding claw lift than females of similar feeding rate/feeding claw per min. This study is the first one to demonstrate that taking higher numbers of pinches/feeding claw per min than comparable sized females, and taking higher numbers of pinches/feeding claw lift than females of similar feeding rate/claw per min are used as additional compensatory mechanisms for male fiddler crabs to compensate for having only one feeding claw. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016.",

On the basis of video recordings of feeding motions and duration, and morphometric measurements of body size (measured as carapace width) and feeding claw size (measured as dactyl length and width), differences in feeding rate per crab and per feeding claw, feeding duration, and feeding claw size between sexes were studied with the main aim to test male ability to compensate for the loss of one functional feeding claw. Additionally, feeding rate of males and females of small and large size classes was studied. Furthermore, correlations between feeding rate and body size, as well as feeding claw size and body size were investigated. Results showed that increased feeding rate per feeding claw coupled with a larger feeding claw allowed males to compensate for the loss of one feeding claw. Smaller males and females fed faster than larger ones. There was a negative correlation between feeding rate and carapace width. Feeding duration did not vary between males and females of comparable size. A positive correlation was observed between feeding claw size and carapace width. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

Our results showed that males and females in HD were larger in size than those in LD. Since HD males were larger in size, they built higher quality burrows than males in LD. On the other hand, even though LD females were smaller in size than HD ones, they built higher quality burrows than HD females.

The results showed no differences in crab density, sex ratio, and body size among the three distances. The percent moisture content at 2 m distance was higher than at 4 and 6 m, and the percentage organic matter at 2 m distance was higher than at 6 m distance. Burrows were shorter in length, shallower in depth, and smaller in volume at 2 m distance, but these measures increased with increasing distance from the river edge.

Data on monthly-notified cases of dengue fever, over the period of January 1981 - June 2012 were collected from the Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health. Weather data over the same period were obtained from the Thai Meteorological Department. Spearman correlation analysis and time-series adjusted Poisson regression analysis were performed to quantify the relationship between weather and the number of dengue cases. The results showed that maximum and minimum temperatures at a lag of zero months, the amount of rainfall, and relative humidity at a lag of two months were significant predictors of dengue incidence in Nakhon Si Thammarat. The time series Poisson regression model demonstrated goodness-of-fit with a correlation between observed and predicted number of dengue incidence rate of 91.82%. This model could be used to optimise dengue prevention by predicting trends in dengue incidence. Accurate predictions, for even a few months, provide an invaluable opportunity to mount a vector control intervention or to prepare for hospital demand in the community.",

This study investigated the effect of seasonal variation on the abundance of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae and explored the impact of weather variability on dengue transmission in Sisaket, Thailand. Methods: The monthly mosquito larval surveys were carried out in urban and rural areas in Sisaket, Thailand from January to December 2010. Data on monthly-reported cases of dengue fever over the period 2004-2010 were obtained from the Ministry of Public Health. Weather data over the same period were obtained from the Thai Meteorological Department. Chi-square test was used to find the differences relating to seasonal variability, areas of study, and mosquito species factors using entomological survey data. Time series Poisson regression analysis was performed using data on monthly weather variables and dengue cases. Results: There were more Ae. aegypti larvae per household than Ae. albopictus larvae in the winter and rainy seasons. More Aedes larvae per household were found in the rainy season than in the winter and summer seasons. Relative humidity at a lag of one month and rainy days in the current month were significant predictors of dengue incidence in Sisaket. Interpretation & conclusions: Increased rain during the current month and less humidity during the previous month might trigger a higher incidence of dengue epidemic in Sisaket. The present findings suggest that the dengue incidence corresponds with the number of Aedes larvae. The seasonal patterns of dengue outbreaks coincide with the rainy season.",

  "abstract": "Parah (Elateriospermum tapos Blume) is a native species of southern Thailand. There are few studies of Parah clusters at Khao Nan National Park, Nakhon Si Thammarat, but no investigation of the locations and boundaries of this species has been undertaken. This study is the first attempt to use open standard Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to investigate Parah forest clusters. Park rangers used a Global Positioning System (GPS) device, a Garmin 76CSx, to survey Parah cluster boundaries during May - June 2011. The coordinates of the Parah boundary were analysed in MapSource and overlaid on a Google Earth map. The area of Parah clusters was then estimated. There are five main clusters of Parah forests at Khao Nan National Park: (1) Ban Na Phra Chao, (2) Ban Tub Namtao, (3) Ban Hok Phu, (4) Namtok Hin Toh site 1 and (5) Namtok Hin Toh site 2. The Parah cluster at Ban Tub Namtao was the largest Parah cluster with a total area of 410.08 hectares. The total area of the five main Parah forests was 810.24 hectares. The size distribution of Parah trees and its density was varied among Parah clusters.",

  "abstract": "this paper introduces a new approach for visualizing multidimentional weather-direction-related time-series data sets called \"3D Spring Model\". Spring Model is designed to visualize pattern behind large time-series weather data set and to clearify seasonal structure in the data. In addition, it supports visibility of seasonal shift and wind direction anomaly by direct comparison betweem successive spring cycles. The visualization contained three data types: (1) Weather parameter (such as windrun, temperature or rainfall etc.), (2) Wind directions and (3) time. We mapped the color to the model in such the way that it comply with human perception using color gradient. Level-Of-Detail scheme is applied and adjustable resulting different pattern time focus for users. Spring Model is highly self-contained for accumulative long term data. It is interactive, flexible and user-friendly. Spring Model is very well-suited to high computing power visualization environment. At the end of the paper, the observation of weather pattern in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand using Spring Model was proposed as the case study to present the model vast applications. © 2012 IEEE.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed at developing a predicting model on the incidence rate of dengue fever in four locations of Thailand - i.e. the northern region, Chiang Rai province, the northeastern region and Sisaket province - using time series analysis. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was performed using data on monthly incidence rate of dengue fever from 1981 to 2009, and validated using the monthly rate collected for the period January 2010 to October 2011. The results show that the SARIMA(1,0,1)(0,1,1)12 model is the most suitable model in all locations. The model for all locations indicated that the predicted dengue incidence rate and the actual dengue incidence rate matched reasonably well. The model was further validated by the Portmanteau test with no significant autocorrelation between residuals at different lag times. Our findings indicate that SARIMA model is a useful tool for monitoring dengue incidence in Thailand. Furthermore, this model can be applied to surveillance data for early warning systems for control and reduction of dengue transmission.",

Simulation of large scale problems is almost impossible to run on a single personal computer and cannot be solved in a reasonable time. Parallelization of problems is achieved by using horizontal domain decomposition while each decomposed domain is computed on each processor of personal computers, PC Cluster. We developed a PC Cluster, namely Walailak University Cluster of 16 Slave processors Pentium 4 (WAC16P4 Cluster). A software of Parallel Computing Toolkit and the Server Message Block Protocol are applied with a new parallel computing technique, which can communicate with adjacent slave processors via the Server Message Block protocol. A WAC16P4 Cluster is an efficient parallel computing facility. This WAC16P4 Cluster is tested by running large-scale water flow simulation by Lattice Boltzmann Method to achieve faster speed. The results are comparable to a small-scale simulation of previous work and the speedup is linearly proportional to the number of processors.",

The climatic factors comprised rainfall, rainy days, relative humidity and maximum, minimum and mean temperatures. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to explore the primary association between the DHF incidence and all climatic factors. Step-wise regression technique was then used to fit the statistical model. The result indicated that the mean temperature, rainfall and relative humidity were associated with the DHF incidence in the areas bordering on the Andaman Sea, while minimum temperature, rainy days and relative humidity were associated with the DHF incidence on the Gulf of Thailand side of the southern peninsula.",

  "abstract": "The distribution, morphology, population density, and adult sex ratio of fiddler crabs in southern Thailand were studied. Nine (sub-)species of fiddler crab were found: Uca lactea annulipes (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), U. triangularis bengali Crane, 1975, U. forcipata (Adams & White, 1848), U. vocans hesperiae Crane, 1975, U. lactea perplexa (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), U. rosea (Tweedie, 1937), U. paradussumieri Bott, 1973, U. tetragonon (Herbst, 1790), and U. urvillei (H. Milne Edwards, 1852). Three forms occurred in both the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand: U. v. hesperiae, U. forcipata, and U. l. annulipes. The population densities of these three were higher in the Andaman Sea. In four species, more than 50% of the males were right-handed: U. tetragonon, U. t. bengali, U. v. hesperiae, and U. forcipata. More than 50% of the males in eight out of the nine species had brachychelous claws. Only U. tetragonon males had brachychelous and leptochelous claws in equal proportions. Six out of nine species in the Andaman Sea and two out of three species in the Gulf of Thailand had male-biased sex ratios.",

Ae. albopictus larvae were found in higher numbers in the seaside area than in the mountainous area. All three Aedes larval indices: Container Index (CI), House Index (HI) and Breteau Index (BI), indicated a high risk of DHF transmission in both locations and faith-based communities.

Ae. aegypti larvae were found most in preserved areca jars in mangrove and mountainous areas and in banana trees in rice paddy areas. Ae. albopictus larvae were found most in preserved areca jars in mangrove areas, in plant axils in rice paddy areas and in metal boxes in mountainous areas. Ae. albopictus larval indices were higher than Ae. aegypti larval indices in all three topographical areas. House index (HI) and Breteau index (BI) were not different in the three topographical areas but different between mosquito species. HI for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in all three topographical areas were greater than 10%, which indicated high risk of DHF transmission in these areas.",

This is the ultimate goal of all the various processes and strategies created to meet the needs of people living together in communities. We propose a holistic integrated visualization, in the form of a community well-being assessment system, as a web-based advanced tool to be used by the executive and health officers of the sub-district administration organization (SAO) network to improve decision-making in order to strengthen their communities. Data were obtained from the Family and Community Assessment Program (FAP) and the SAO in nine sub-districts, covering all of the four regions of Thailand. The system incorporates dashboard architecture and assists the executive and health officers in the SAO to achieve better decision-making for the deployment of proper measures in communities. The model was developed for the Pakpoon SAO and was applied to the other eight SAOs. In order to evaluate the model, 243 users, covering all user groups from three sites, were asked to answer 18 questions during a meeting. The overall average score for user satisfaction was 4.12. The results indicate that this model can be used for community well-being assessment, in order to improve decision-making to strengthen communities in Thailand. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

All crabs spent more time on feeding than on other activities. Females spent more time on standing and staying inside burrows than males did, and males spent more time on grooming than females did. BOs spent more time on feeding and fighting than COs, and COs spent more time on grooming and waving than BOs did. Female BOs showed higher feeding rates than female COs, but feeding rates did not differ between male BOs and COs.

There are many ways for companies to collaborate with remote experts or partners in designing, manufacturing, or distributing the new product, depending on how complicated the product is. With the progress in information technology, many techniques can be used for supporting collaborative work. For the design that needs specific or complicates visual appearance, Augmented Reality (AR) is the most promising one. The virtual 3D model can be distributed to the remote partners for evaluation and providing comments. In this research, the technique in generating a stable large 3D model for remote design collaboration using multiple markers was developed. Users from different locations can work on the same virtual model. The platform for the mobile application was also developed. The results from the experiment with this setup confirmed that the system could be used for real collaboration. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

  "abstract": "During the past decade, there has been some significant drop in the number of Thai students taking sciences class, even though the country is struggling to transform the economy into an innovation-driven one which needed lots of scientists. These may relate to many sources, but the most important one is the lack of inspiration and motivation in science. To fix these problems, we have to get them inspiration for sciences and augmented reality (AR) is the suitable technology to answer this question. In this experiment, children will be guided to learn about fish and build the virtual aquarium using AR. The children can create their 3D virtual fish from the 2D picture and let them swim in the aquarium. Testing this concept, we have found that lots of children start with curiosity about how it has been done and then went to try and finally enjoy the output.

  "abstract": "Many people suffer from movement disabilities and would benefit from an assistive mobility device with practical control. This paper demonstrates a face-machine interface system that uses motion artifacts from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for mobility enhancement in people with quadriplegia. We employed an Emotiv EPOC X neuroheadset to acquire EEG signals. With the proposed system, we verified the preprocessing approach, feature extraction algorithms, and control modalities. Incorporating eye winks and jaw movements, an average accuracy of 96.9% across four commands was achieved. Moreover, the online control results of a simulated power wheelchair showed high efficiency based on the time condition. The combination of winking and jaw chewing results in a steering time on the same order of magnitude as that of joystickbased control, but still about twice as long. We will further improve the efficiency and implement the proposed face-machine interface system for a real-power wheelchair. © 2021 Authors. All Rights Reserved.",

  "abstract": "The number of time that heart beats per one minute we call it as the heart rate or pulse. It is an indicator for monitoring health. In this paper, we present the Burn in Zone: Physical activity real-Time heart rate monitoring, a novel model to help people who prefer to have a more physical activity to continue their intention in the long term. We were mainly interested in real-Time heart rate monitoring and target heart rate zone, not its ability to change behavior. This model will help those people to monitor their heart rate while having physical activity in line with their target heart rate or training heart rate (THR). THR is the desired range of heart rate reached during physical activity. It is calculated from the percentage of the physical activity intensity (PAI) multiply with Maximum Heart Rate (MHR), the highest heart rate of each person can work efficiently and safely without severe problems through exercise stress. In this research, we developed an android wear application for getting a real-Time pulse from the heart sensor in Android Smart Watch. We had collected data from undergraduate and graduate students from the School of Informatics, Walailak University, who volunteer to be part of this experiment. There are twenty-six volunteers with age ranges from nineteen to forty-Two-year-olds. Among the volunteers, there are twelve males (46.15%) and fourteen females (53.85%). We separated the samples into two groups, controlled group and experimental group. The experimental criteria are cycling on a stationary bicycle with six minutes for each people. Results from the experiment showed that the percentage of heart rate of the controlled group and the experimental group were consistent with the experimental setup criteria for monitoring the heart rate data on Android wear. For future work, we plan to implement the game design elements to encourage the people to have more level of physical activity and continue their physical activity. © 2017 IEEE.",

  "abstract": "CPR, or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, is a lifesaving technique useful for the case in which someone's heartbeat or breathing has stopped due to heart attack. Without proper CPR, nine out of ten patients die. The American Heart Association recommends CPR with chest compressions in the event of witnessing such an incident. For proper CPR training, taking a class with a CPR instructor is usually the best choice, but it is not practical and costly for mass training, especially in schools and universities. There are many new techniques available that can replace traditional CPR training and Augmented Reality (AR) is one of them. AR is the technology that integrates virtual objects or environments, created by digital technology, with the real world. Augmented Reality using marker-based technique is a good option, since a trainee can have a realistic look at the patient, know the position of the hand on the chest, identify the number of chest compressions per minute, and also know the pressure that he or she puts on the chest. Besides that, the status of the operation can be displayed along with a recording system for analysis. In this research, we chose marker-based AR due to its precision in distance measurement. For measuring the pressure on the chest, we use a marker-marker interaction technique. Unity 3D cross-platform game engine and Qualcomm's Vuforia-an augmented reality software development kit (SDK) for mobile devices that enables the creation of augmented reality applications-are required. The results from our experiment with a group of people with non-CPR training confirm that the configuration increases the speed and accuracy of CPR training. © IJTech 2019.",

  "abstract": "Pulse signals can be used to observe the early sign of patients' health problems. From medical researches, monitoring the characteristic of arterial pulse waveform shows some risk indicator of specific diseases, e.g., hypertension, cardiovascular and heart failure diseases. A simple way to get arterial pulse wave is by using fingers to touch the radial artery position on the wrist. In the traditional Chinese medicine, a physician can use the information of arterial pulse wave-form to identify diseases based on the physician's ability and experience. The improvement of the skill in pulse measurement can be improved by training using various kinds of pulses that represent each disease. This paper proposes a development of the virtual pulse simulation using Augmented Reality (AR) and haptic device for pulse diagnosis studies under various situations. The pulse simulation generates arterial pulse waveforms based on Sine and Gaussian functions. In this study, the mathematical model can generate the pulse wave like human pulse by setting up specific parameters. We can generate pulse waveform which representing different kinds and states of diseases by varying the mathematical model and parameters such as pulse rate or pulse pressure. The features of this work include how to generate force feedback from the mathematical models using the haptic device and how the virtual 3D can display visual feedback. The pulse simulation is useful for the health sciences students, especially the nursing students in training to identify some diseases. The evaluation of the system was carried out by first-year nursing students regarding usability, satisfaction, and performance. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.",

  "abstract": "At present, new technology affects daily life in both direct and indirect ways. Internet technology can connect people around the world through social networks. It can facilitate online shopping or e-commerce, which is the popular culture of today business. Contents provided in the online shopping must be in the form that customer can interact with, i.e., it must be converted from analog data to digital information. For apparel or clothing business, only picture and information of the dresses, such as size, color, etc., may not be enough, since the customer did not know whether it will fit their bodies or not. To make sure that the dress they wanted to buy fit their body, the body size of the customers must be known. With the known body size, generating the 3D model of the customer to try on the 3D virtual model of the dress is possible, and the decision to buy is possible. There are many ways to find the exact body size and generate a 3D model of the customers i.e. using 3D scanner, using Photogrammetry technique (merging many photographs of the customers' bodies to create the 3d model) or generating 3D model with known information using 3d computer graphic software such as Autodesk Maya, 3D max. The techniques mentioned above have some drawback because it required either an expensive device or expert to create a 3D model which may take a long time. Therefore in this research, we present the technique using marker-based Augmented Reality to acquire the shape of the objects. By wrapping the markers around the surface of the object that we want to measure, each marker's position can be identified, and when combined, the shape and sizes of the object can be created. This technique takes a shorter time than other method and does not require any sophisticated device but still give good results. We separate the experiment into three groups, group one, testing the concept with five objects with different sizes and shapes with one row markers and group two, testing cylindrical objects with four row markers, and group three, testing with a mannequin to find the shape of human's body. we have found that the shape and size of the objects that we have created are very close to the real one with the maximum error of less than 5%. It possible to generate the whole 3D object which can be adjusted to support virtual fitting room. © Insight Society.",

  "abstract": "Gamification is a conceptual framework to apply game elements and techniques to improve the interesting process in non-game context. Gamification offers the motivation approach to motivate the player to handle the challenge tasks with game mechanics, game dynamics, and components. Nowadays, To discover the set of game elements and techniques from evaluating the existing related research is more opportunity for success in the exciting process. The core objective of this paper is to review the literature by using descriptive statistics of game elements with the review methodology. The reviewed literature was first coded author-centrally. After each paper was scrutinized for the analysis, the perspective was pivoted, and further analyses were conducted concept-centrally. A systematic review has been conducted that proves the wide variety of game elements, being retrieved a total of fifteen terms of game elements from twentytwo selected papers that were screened from a total of eighty-two documents. Only a few terms are used: points, feedback, levels, leaderboards, challenges, badges, avatars, competition, and cooperation. However, only some can be considered actual elements mechanics and that have not a similar abstraction level. Additionally, the authors examined the relationship between game elements and Self-Determination Theory (SDT): Competence, Autonomy, and Relatedness. The results indicated that a few terms of game elements were used: points, feedback, levels, leaderboards, challenges, badges, avatars, competition, and cooperation to explaine the relationship to SDT: Competence, Autonomy, and Relatedness. The results from this study will be used to design a gamified system in a healthcare context to promote physical activity. © 2019 OmniaScience.",

The objective of this research is to find the algorithm for measuring the size and find the shape of the room for facility management using marker-based AR technology. The applications program was designed and developed using the Unity 3D game engine and OpenCV library. It was designed to be used by many devices running on various operating systems such as Windows, OSX, iOS, and Android. Test of the concept was done in three situations, i.e., three rooms with different sizes. The first room is the smallest one with the size = 25.245 m3. The second room is the biggest one with the size of 117.35 m3 and the third one with the size = 56.1 m3. The results calculating from the distances of the markers show that the sizes of the space obtaining from the application are different from the manual measure less than 3%, which means that the system can provide high accuracy in measurement. © 2020 The Authors.

  "abstract": "The research on the electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain–computer interface (BCI) is widely utilized for wheelchair control. The ability of the user is one factor of BCI efficiency. Therefore, we focused on BCI tasks and protocols to yield high efficiency from the robust EEG features of individual users. This study proposes a task-based brain activity to gain the power of the alpha band, which included eyes closed for alpha response at the occipital area, attention to an upward arrow for alpha response at the frontal area, and an imagined left/right motor for alpha event-related desynchronization at the left/right motor cortex. An EPOC X neuroheadset was used to acquire the EEG signals. We also proposed user proficiency in motor imagery sessions with limb movement paradigms by recommending motor imagination tasks. Using the proposed system, we verified the feature extraction algorithms and command translation. Twelve volunteers participated in the experiment, and the conventional paradigm of motor imagery was used to compare the efficiencies. With utilized user proficiency in motor imagery, an average accuracy of 83.7% across the left and right commands was achieved. The recommended MI paradigm via user proficiency achieved an approximately 4% higher accuracy than the conventional MI paradigm. Moreover, the real-time control results of a simulated wheelchair revealed a high efficiency based on the time condition. The time results for the same task as the joystick-based control were still approximately three times longer. We suggest that user proficiency be used to recommend an individual MI paradigm for beginners. Furthermore, the proposed BCI system can be used for electric wheelchair control by people with severe disabilities. © 2022 by the authors.",

  "abstract": "More than 5% of Thai people have strabismus. Strabismus is known as cross-eyed or wall-eyed because the visual field angle of two eyes is not parallel. The amblyopia disease is the cause of strabismus in kids. Strabismus can be completely cured if the strabismus screening can be made in early stage. Currently, strabismus screening includes methods such as Hirschberg test, cover test and Krimsky test, and etc. The strabismus screening in kids is difficult and takes a lot time in special room. This research intend to develop a computer system to assist strabismus screening using the combination of computer games and eye tracking devices so that the screening results will be more accurate and exact. This screening technique requires shorter time and it is easy to use, so it is better in terms of efficiency and reducing time for strabismus screening. © 2017 IEEE.",

  "abstract": "One of the primary reasons of injury related to death not only in elderlies but also in young people is slip trip and fall accidents. It will be very useful if fall accidents can be detected in pre-fall and critical fall phase long enough before the human body impact to the floor. Pre-impact fall detection method and lead time before impact are very important factors that has been used to save a person who takes risks. In this paper, multiple viewpoints in vision based sensing that provided by multiple Kinect sensors using dynamic threshold based and center of gravity are proposed. Pre-fall detection alert will be triggered by acceleration of head position compared with dynamic threshold based approach and range of center of gravity compared with base of support area. Moreover using blinding technique without video stream recording is one of useful feature in our vision based approach for reducing privacy issue. Not only fall actions but also a series of normal activities in daily living such as sitting, bending and laying were performed by 10 young adult volunteers. Results from the experiments indicate that the proposed method lead time is about 500 milliseconds which is faster than previous proposition and it is appropriate for airbags inflation triggering. © 2017 IEEE.",

  "abstract": "Anatomy is considered one of the foundation studies for all of the health science students especially medical and nursing students. Anatomy of the hand is complicated. It composes of bones, nerves, blood veins, muscles, and tendon. Memorising all the details about all those parts is tedious work and need much imagination. With the advances in computer graphics and humancomputer interaction techniques, understanding how those body parts move is easy to understand in a visual presentation. Augmented Reality (AR) is the technique that allowed the computer-generated objects to overlay on top of the real world. In this study, we concentrate on studying the bones only. We have selected the Leap Motion, which is the device that can detect the hands and fingers, like a tracking device, and marker-based AR technique for displaying the computer generated bones on top of the real hand. Since the Leap Motion detects the hands and shows the bone in real time, so when a user moves the hands such as waving, all the 3D virtual bones move to the new position just like the real hand. Besides using this tool as the educational tool to help the students have better learning about anatomy, it can also be used as an assessment tool for anatomy class as well. Results from testing this tool with volunteer students indicate that it helps them to understand the hand anatomy better and faster than traditional ways. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.",

We experimented with sixteen students (62.5% male and 37.5% female, age between eighteen through twenty- three year old) of the Informatics school at Walailak University. We had the experimental setup to evaluate model performance for baseline models, booting ensemble model, and begging ensemble model. When we measured model's performance, we found the follows results. First, the baseline models performance has the highest accuracy level with KNN: k-Nearest Neighbor with k = 9 is 95.47%. Second, The Boosting ensemble models performance has the highest accuracy level with C5.0: C5.0 is 95.63%. Third, The Bagging ensemble models performance has the highest accuracy level with RF: Random Forest is 95.69%. Fourth, The Stacking ensemble models performance has the highest accuracy level with KNN is 95.52%. So, we concluded that RF has the highest performance with accuracy level at 95.69%. In the future work, we planned to get more accuracy model by adding more features from another sensor, heart rate. Mining data collected from sensors provide valuable result in the physical activity recognition area. The improvement in performance is required especially in the healthcare field. The more increasing of using the wearable device, the broader opportunity in the data mining research area can be. © 2018 Author(s).",

They also have to understand the result of each command execution, step by step. In this research, we propose the technique for developing the learning tool (AR flowchart) to simulate the result of the commands in program flowchart by using augmented reality (AR), so the learners can visualize the result. With this tool, the students can construct a program flowchart as a series of commands by using AR markers. The result of the execution of these commands can be displayed so the students can see whether the logic of the program is correct or not. The design of this tool aims at increasing student engagement and helping them to understand program logic better.

Some of the difficult problems are obtrusion, occlusion and overlay in vision based system. Other associated issues are privacy, cost, noise, computation complexity and definition of threshold values. Estimating human motion using vision based usually involves with partial overlay, caused either by direction of view point between objects or body parts and camera, and these issues have to be taken into consideration. This paper proposes the use of dynamic threshold based and bounding box posture analysis method with multiple Kinect cameras setting for human posture analysis and fall detection. The proposed work only uses two Kinect cameras for acquiring distributed values and differentiating activities between normal and falls. If the peak value of head velocity is greater than the dynamic threshold value, bounding box posture analysis will be used to confirm fall occurrence. Furthermore, information captured by multiple Kinect placed in right angle will address the skeleton overlay problem due to single Kinect. This work contributes on the fusion of multiple Kinect based skeletons, based on dynamic threshold and bounding box posture analysis which is the only research work reported so far. © 2017 SPIE.",

To link data from several formats, data are transformed into database format, and they are mapped to ontology. The ontology is developed with concepts provided in the dataset. Mainly, the developed ontol-ogy contains a concept of drug, disease, genetic and drug-gene interaction with their details. The ontology is used as central schema to link concepts together; thus, linked data are created. Within the linked data, we found three types of links, i.e. addition of instances, addition of attributes and changing of variable data field to a link to another table. In this paper, actual scenarios of the found links with exemplified data are explained.",

  "abstract": "Microsoft's Kinect has been used in many augmented reality applications and most of them for interactive purpose. But since the Kinect is a device with depth sensing technology, it has been used for capturing the figure both 2D and 3D as well. In this research, we would like to create a 3D model or avatar which has the shape just like the actual human. Dealing with 3D avatar requires less computer resource than actual 3D model getting from 3D scanner. The purpose of this work is to transform the 2D measured shape of the human body into the standard 3D avatar. The new Kinect2 for windows with Depth Frame and Skeleton Frame function was used for body measurement. Using T-pose and A-pose position, measurement of the width of parts of the body at each joint (Kinect joint: i.e. Shoulder Center Joint, Spine Joint, Hip Center Joint, Hip Left Joint, Knee Left Joint, Ankle Left Joint, Foot left Joint and etc.) can be done easily. Since both sides of the body were measured (T-pose and A-pose), the circumference at each node can be calculated. In order to transform these data into 3D Model that representing human body, a standard model of 3D avatar was created. The size of the human part (measured at the node) was compared with the standard 3D model. If the measured size is larger than the standard one, then we had to scale the size of the standard model up but if the measured size is smaller, then we have to scale down. To make a perfect 3D model, technique called \"Soft Selection\" was used. Soft Selection is the technique for gradually scaling each node smoothly to match the second node. If we scale without using this technique, then there will be a bump occurred from one node to other. The 3D avatar model created this way will have the same shape as the human body it represented and can be used in many applications such as virtual fitting room, augmented reality games and etc. © 2015 The Authors.",

  "abstract": "Virtual Dressing Room (VDR) is the popular topics during the past 10 years and it seemed to have the bright future when Microsoft's Kinect tracking system appeared in the market. The VDR is not only helping the online customer making decision on buying apparels but also helping customers in department store to save time in waiting for the fitting room. In facts, there are few parts of VDR that make virtual fitting more realistic and tracking the movement of the body is only one of them. The other parts are dealing with the clothing and how they interact with the body even when the customer moves around. The virtual fitting rooms available in the market today and on the website used 2D dresses putting in front of the body. These dresses did not fit on the body and did not interact with the body except they were appeared on the front part of the body. In order to make the simulation process of the virtual fitting room more realistic, 3D virtual dress will be used along with the physical interaction of the fabrics and the environment. In this research, we have to define the shape of the 3D dress and the physical properties of the fabrics. Since the dress did not come as one piece of fabrics but composed of many pieces with different textures and physical properties, for example, some parts is thicker than others or made with different materials, so all these issues have to be taken into account. In this research, the interaction occurred between fabric and the environment were calculated and applied. This covered all of the interactions occurred on the fabrics such as stretching, bending, damping, accelerating, colliding and gravity pulling. The simulation results can tell the difference among customers wearing jean, satin, silk or cotton. In this research, Unity 3D game engine was used for simulation process along with Maya for model creation and Microsoft's Kinect2 was used for tracking the dress and the body. © 2015 The Authors.

  "abstract": "Augmented Reality is the combination of virtual objects (created by computer i.e. video, texts or 3D computer models) overlay on top of real world image. Applications of Augmented Reality can be ranged from advertising, edutainment, education, engineering, medicine to industrial manufacturing. In basic applications, like in advertisement or games, users only see the actions or interact with part of the screen designed for initiate some actions. In order to make users have realistic experiences, the interaction amongst virtual objects in Augmented Reality must be restricted to the law of Physics. Virtual objects can have their own dimensions, volumes or weights. When interaction between virtual objects occurred, the collision for example, they should not penetrate each other. The objects will react to each other by the law of Physics. With this concept, all kinds of experiments can be tested or practiced without spending a lot of fortunes with the real setup ranging from simple science experiment, medical training or even assembly process of equipment. In this research, Unity 3D game engine is used on Vuforia platform. Unity is a fully integrated development engine for creating games and other interactive 3D content and Vuforia platform make it possible to write a single native application that runs on almost all smartphones and tablets. To test the concept, 8 pieces of virtual 3D puzzle modules were created using 8 markers. Each virtual module was assigned with physical properties such dimensions, shapes and positions. When assemble the puzzle, each piece of the marker must be able to move around so that the virtual modules can fit to each other. By lifting and rotating the markers, the virtual module will snap with the other proper virtual part, forming virtual 3D puzzle. The virtual module will not penetrate each other because they have their own territory due to their dimensions. With this experiment, users will have a realistic feeling on assembling the virtual model. The concept can be implemented for experiments that are dangerous or expensive to setup. Experiments related to interaction between objects such as physics and chemistry experiments, engineering and medical training are the main targets for using this kind of technology. © 2013 The Authors.

  "abstract": "In the past few years, studying in the field of Augmented Reality (AR) has been expanded from technical aspect such as tracking system, authoring tools and etc. to applications ranging from the fields of education, entertainment, medicine to manufacturing. In manufacturing, which relies on assembly process, AR is used for assisting staffs in the field of maintenance and assembly. Usually, it has been used as a guidance system, for example using graphical instructions for advising the users with the steps in performing the maintenance or assembly operation. In assembly training, especially for small, expensive or harmful devices, interactive technique using real hands may be suitable than the guiding technique. Using tracking algorithm to track both hands in real time, interaction can occurs by the execution of grasp and release gestures. Bare hand tracking technique, which uses gesture recognition to enable interaction with augmented objects are also possible. In this paper, we attempted to use marker based AR technique to assemble 3D virtual objects using natural hand interaction. By applying the markers to fit on fingertip and assigned the corresponding virtual 3D finger that have physical properties such as surface, volume, density, friction and collision detection properties to them, interaction between fingers and objects could be executed. This setup was designed on a PC based system but could be ported to iOS or Android, so that it would work on tablet or mobile phones as well. Unity 3D game engine was used with Vuforia AR platform. In order to grab and move the virtual object by hand, the shape of the virtual finger (Vulforia's target) has been investigated. Appropriate friction coefficient were applied to both virtual fingers and the object and then at least two virtual fingers were force to press on the 3D virtual object in opposite directions so that frictional force is more than gravitational force. To test this method, virtual model of LEGO's mini-figures which composed of five pieces, was used and the assembly could be done in just a short time. Comparing with other popular technique such as \"gestures recognition\", we have found that our technique could provide more efficient result in term of cost and natural feeling. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",

Most of \"fall detection\" systems are focused on critical and post-fall phase which mean that the faller may already be injured. In this study, we propose an early fall detection in critical fall phase using velocity characteristics, collected by Kinect sensor with 30 frames per second. A series of normal and falling activities were performed by 5 volunteers in first experiment and 11 volunteers in second experiment. The fall velocity based point was calculated by the first experiment as 50 postures, 2210 frames recorded. The result from the first experiment, velocity ratio 90.35 pixels per millisecond was calculated by adding ?1 with a, was defined as velocity fall detection based point for the second experiment. In the second experiment, the fall activities were detected at 85.07 percent from 134 fall activities. The mean time of fall activities that was detected before dash to the ground is 391.15 milliseconds. The detected mean time may be useful to developing a preventive fall system to protect the faller before injured i.e. wearable airbag system. For high accuracy prediction, automatically adjusted vertical fall based point by train dataset of individual person will be investigated in future work.",

Since MR can simulate 3D objects and environments, bringing the user into a virtual world, it allows more perspectives than are seen by using traditional media. MR can be applied to simulate a real fitting room, where the user can try on a virtual dress without taking off any of their clothes. Additionally, it can estimate the size of the user, so they will know their correct clothing size before buying. This MR technology is a powerful decision-making tool for customers in an online clothes shopping environment. By simulating a virtual garment superimposed upon the user body, users can try on virtual clothes as a mirror image, with several angles viewable as they move. This technique can also help customers shop online to select the correct size or type of garment. This should increase confidence when buying garments from websites. Due to advancements in computer technology, a new way to create virtual fitting rooms can be used. In this paper, we have surveyed methodologies and experiments conducted in building virtual fitting rooms. From the survey, it was found that making a good virtual fitting room relies on 2 important factors, i.e., the method of detecting the user’s body size, position, and movement, and the method of displaying the virtual garments superimposed on the user’s body. The first factors are usually solved either by using devices, like Microsoft’s Kinect or the Image Processing technique. The second factor can be accomplished by using augmented reality technology. © 2017, Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "The fundamental theories and concepts of digital electronics which usually being taught at entry level electronics courses is designed to help the students develop solid underlying knowledge of how computer works. The topics usually covered Boolean algebra, Logic Gates and etc. Beside Theory, which are being taught in the lectures, practical skill is required by doing the experiments. In the past the digital electronics laboratory is needed for this purpose, but recently, it was replaced by the software that can simulate the digital circuits. The advantage of this software is that, the students can study the behavior of a systems without building them which save a lot of time and expense. The drawback of these simulators is that, it lacks real charisma in performing the experiments and difficult to interpret. In this research, we have applied interactive marker-based augmented reality (AR) to solve these problems. The advantage of using this marker based techniques in this research is that we can implant the functions of each logic gates in the marker and program these markers to interact with others just like in the real logic gates laboratory. The other advantage is that, markers can be in any shape or have any pictures or symbol on it which make user recognize them easily. In this research, we have created 9 markers which represent 7 basic Logic gates i.e. AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate, NAND gate, NOR gate, XOR gate and XNOR gate. Since we can implant the functions of each logic gates in the marker, the output from these markers will represent the function of each logic gate. By adding them together, the output will be the same as adding the logic gates together. The advantage of using this marker based AR techniques is that we can construct the digital circuit using these markers and the output will be just the same as using the real logic gates, except there is no need for power supply and can be done anywhere and anytime. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",

We observed I- and J-shaped burrows in both ovigerous and non-ovigerous females, with higher numbers of J-shaped burrows in ovigerous females. However, in non-ovigerous females, I- and J-shaped burrow numbers were not different. Other burrow characteristics had higher values in ovigerous females than in non-ovigerous females. In ovigerous females, I- and J-shaped burrows were not different in diameters, total lengths, total depths, or volumes, but horizontal lengths, ground angles and mid angles were higher in J-shaped burrows. In non-ovigerous females, burrow characteristics (except diameter) were higher in J-shaped burrows than in I-shaped burrows. Our results show for the first time that burrow characteristics differ based on the reproductive status of female fiddler crabs in T. rosea. © 2018 Copyright 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

  "abstract": "Reef fish play an important role in the community dynamics of coral reefs and maintaining healthy reefs. This study aimed to (1) assess coral recovery at reefs around Racha Yai Island after the 2010 mass coral bleaching event and (2) compare the fish community indices (Shannon diversity, evenness) and fish trophic functional groups between low (Patok Bay) and high (Khonkae Bay) environmental disturbance sites during 2013-2019. The fish surveys and the percent live cora covers from both bays during 2013-2019 were collected using the fish visual census method and a permanent quadrat method along 50-m transect lines. Our results showed that the percentage of live coral cover at both bays increased by 6 8%. At Khonkae Bay, there were 69 reef fish species and 10,684 individual fish belonging to 5 orders, with 27 families and 54 genera observed from 7 orders: Perciformes (91.03%), Tetraodontiformes (5.54%), Syngnathiformes (1.24%) Beloniformes (0.26%), Beryciformes (1.25%), Scorpaeniformes (0.70%), and Aulopiformes (0.06%). Fish community indices at Khonkae Bay increased during 2013-2019 and were composed of species richness (3.65-10.53), the Shannon index (0.65 3.49), and species evenness (0.49-0.91). At Patok Bay, there were 60 reef fish species and 10,362 individual fish belonging to 3 orders, with 22 families and 50 genera observed from 4 orders: Perciformes (93.04%), Tetraodontiformes (5.92%), Syngnathiformes (0.55%), and Anguilliformes (0.53%). Fish community indices at Patok Bay increased during 2014-2019 and were composed of species richness (4.69-8.62), the Shannon index (1.36-3.30), and species evenness (4.92-8.62). Ou results suggested that the 2010 mass coral bleaching event had large impacts on both the coral and reef fish community at both low and high environmental disturbance sites with good recovery over nine years. © 2021 Malque Publishing.

  "abstract": "Usually, Culex mosquitoes are responsible for spreading several human diseases such as malaria, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, filariasis, and Zika. Lymphatic filariasis and Zika cases are increasing in Thailand with more prevalent in southern Thailand. In this study, our aim is to examine how seasons and water container types affect Culex spp. larvae numbers in Lansaka district, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, southern Thailand. This study was conducted in five sub-districts (Lansaka, Khaokaew, Thadi, Kamlon, and Khunthale) in Lansaka district. In each sub-district, 120 houses were randomly selected to study the breeding sites of Culex mosquito in dry (March-May, 2018) and wet (October-December, 2018) seasons. Mosquito larvae were collected from indoor, outdoor, natural, artificial, dark-coloured, light-coloured, with lid, and without lid containers. It was observed that in all sub-districts, Culex larvae numbers were higher in dry season compared to wet season. In both seasons, outdoor, without lid, dark-coloured, and artificial containers contained more Culex larvae than inside, with lid, light-coloured, and natural containers, respectively. This study shows that seasons and water container types affect Culex mosquito larvae. Since the larvae numbers are higher in dry season, as well as in outdoor, without lid, dark-coloured, and artificial containers, people should reduce the usage of these containers, especially in the dry season, to prevent Culex borne diseases. © 2020 Malque Publishing.

Burrow and soil temperatures were measured using temperature sensors and burrow characteristics were recorded. Both sexes built I- and J-shaped burrows. Female burrows were longer and deeper than male burrows, since female burrows act as breeding burrows in this species. J-shaped burrows were longer and slightly deeper than I-shaped ones. During the day, the burrow temperature was lower than the soil temperature; however, during the night, the opposite result was observed. The burrow length/depth was negatively correlated with the burrow temperature during the day, but these correlations were positive during the night. This study shows that the burrow characteristics of T. rosea modulate the inside temperature of the burrows, maintaining a suitable temperature for the crabs.  © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020.",

Milne Edwards, 1852). Female burrows were also examined. The results showed that female burrows were smaller than male burrows, with no chamber and, thus, female burrows are not used for breeding; however, 80% of RCM burrows, and 65% of OCM burrows, had chambers. Other characteristics were not different between RCM and OCM burrows, except for maximum width, which was larger in RCM burrows. The waving rates of OCMs and RCMs were not different. Our results indicate that claw regeneration do not have detrimental effects on male waving rate and burrow characteristics. Copyright © 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in climatic factors and fruit quality between on-and off-season production periods. Climate, soil, and mangosteen measurements were all studied during on-and off-season production. We chose 40 mangosteen trees and observed flowering and fruit set rates over two production periods. The results showed that the number of flowers per branch, the number of fruits per branch, the circumference of fruits, and the fruit weight were higher during the on-season mangosteen production period than during the off-season mangosteen production period. However, the number of edible pulp segments, peel thickness, percentage of translucent flesh, and fruit gumminess were lower in the on-season mangosteen production period than in the off-season mangosteen production period. The percentage of fruit scars did not differ between the on-and off-season mangosteen production periods. When compared to the on-season mangosteen production period, there was lower relative humidity, soil moisture at 120 cm depth, and leaf wetness at 15 cm above ground during the off-season mangosteen production period; however, there was higher air temperature, soil moisture, and soil temperature at all four depth levels. © 2023 by the authors.

Smaller contestants won when body size asymmetries were lesser, but took a longer time to win the contests, while with greater size-Asymmetries, smaller ones lost the contests in a short time. In U.

Results showed that burrow characteristics did not differ between burrows with and without mudballs. Males built larger-sized burrows with greater volumes, and had more mudballs than females. Crabs built J-, I-, L-, S-and U-shaped burrows, with higher numbers of J-shaped burrows in males, and higher numbers of I-shaped burrows in females. J-shaped burrows were larger with greater volumes, and had more mudballs than I-shaped burrows. For burrows with mudballs, mudball numbers were positively associated with burrow characteristics.

Higher numbers of mudballs were excavated from inside the burrows during the build of the burrows by males than by females, and by larger crabs than by smaller ones. Crab carapace width was positively correlated with the time required to build burrows, and with the number of mudballs excavated from inside the burrows during the build of these burrows. We observed that 82% of the females placed the mudballs near their burrow entrance, whereas 85% of the males placed the mudballs far from their burrow entrance. After building the burrows, 71% of the females went inside the burrow and plugged the burrow entrance, and 90% of the males foraged for food. © 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

All crabs spent more time on feeding than on other activities. Females spent more time on standing and staying inside burrows than males did, and males spent more time on grooming than females did. BOs spent more time on feeding and fighting than COs, and COs spent more time on grooming and waving than BOs did. Female BOs showed higher feeding rates than female COs, but feeding rates did not differ between male BOs and COs.

  "abstract": "In animals, both monotasking and multitasking behaviours are observed. Multitasking behaviour helps to increase output quantity, but one activity may distract attention from another, and activities may interact negatively as they compete for the same amount of time available. To test this, we video recorded 23 Austruca Bengali (Crane, 1975) males who were 'feeding only' (monotasking) and 24 males who were 'feeding and courting (waving major claws) females' simultaneously (multitasking). We measured the feeding and waving rates for 'feeding and waving' males, and the feeding rate for 'feeding only' males. We found that the feeding rate of 'feeding only' males was higher, but they reduced their feeding rate when they shared the time for feeding and courting. Moreover, feeding rate was negatively correlated with waving rate for 'feeding and waving' males. Our results indicate that courting activity distracted attention from feeding activity, and that activities interacted negatively with each other. © 2018 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

  "abstract": "Aim: Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are an important aspect of forests and forest use in many parts of the world. The present study aims at examining how local communities have changed their ways of NTFP utilization in the Parah forest after Khao Nan National Park was designated as a national park in the year 2009. Methodology: A questionnaire survey was conducted using 150 randomly selected households from four villages bordering the Parah forest, Khao Nan National Park. The questionnaires were divided into two categories: socio-economics and NTFP utilization. The socio-economics of the interviewees were composed of gender, age group, marital status, education level, number of members/household, principle occupation and level of income. Income was categorized into three income categories, which ranged from poor ([removed]500 $/month), based on the Thailand minimum daily wage. NTFP utilization composed of type of NTFP, harvested quantity and harvesting frequency. Results: NTFPs from the Parah forest were used by 74.67 % of villagers. No differences in the amount of all NTFPs obtained in 2007 and 2015 were found. However, the price of NTFPs has increased over the years, and so the value of NTFPs in the Parah forest in 2015 reached 2,773.36 US Dollars/household, which was much higher than that reported in 2007. The frequency of the NTFPs that were harvested by villagers, ranked from highest to lowest, were as follows: Parah seeds, honey, stink bean fruits (Parkia speciosa), fruits of Archidendron spp., termite mushrooms (Termitomyces spp.), fruits of Parkia javanica, medicinal plants, jiringa fruits (Archidendron jiringa), fruits of Sandoricum koetjape and bamboo shoots. The harvesting quantityofNTFPsdidnotchange after Khao Nan National Park was designated as a National Parkintheyear2009. Interpretation: The existence of a variety of Parah NTFPs are of great importance to the villagers; therefore future planning is needed for conservation and sustainable utilization. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).",

  "abstract": "Aim : Studies on oyster population dynamic is essential for effective oyster aquaculture.Bandon Bay in Southern Thailand is a major shellfish aquaculture site of high commercial value. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on oyster diversity and their distribution in Bandon Bay.Methodology : Adult oysters were collected from eight aquaculture sites during low tide and their body sizes were measured. Monthly, transparency, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, alkalinity, ammonium (NH,-N),nitrite, nitrate and phosphate were recorded from Surat Thani Coastal Fisheries Research and Development Centre, Department of Fisheries. Results : Three oyster species were observed: Crassostrea belcheri, Crassostrea lugubris and Saccostrea forskalii, however, C. belcheri was most abundant at most locations. Oyster density in Bandon Bay was mostly influenced by alkalinity, followed by salinity, pH, NO,andNH4-N. Interpretation : Since oyster reproduction, survival and shell development depend on environmental factors, thus studies on relationships between environmental factors and oyster occurrence/density may provide a better understanding about the community structures and spatial dynamics of oysters, as well as how oysters respond to environmental changes. © 2019 Triveni Enterprises.

This is the ultimate goal of all the various processes and strategies created to meet the needs of people living together in communities. We propose a holistic integrated visualization, in the form of a community well-being assessment system, as a web-based advanced tool to be used by the executive and health officers of the sub-district administration organization (SAO) network to improve decision-making in order to strengthen their communities. Data were obtained from the Family and Community Assessment Program (FAP) and the SAO in nine sub-districts, covering all of the four regions of Thailand. The system incorporates dashboard architecture and assists the executive and health officers in the SAO to achieve better decision-making for the deployment of proper measures in communities. The model was developed for the Pakpoon SAO and was applied to the other eight SAOs. In order to evaluate the model, 243 users, covering all user groups from three sites, were asked to answer 18 questions during a meeting. The overall average score for user satisfaction was 4.12. The results indicate that this model can be used for community well-being assessment, in order to improve decision-making to strengthen communities in Thailand. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

  "abstract": "This study investigated coral and reef fish recovery following the COVID-19 event between low and high environmental disturbance reefs at Racha Yai Island, Southern Thailand. Three and four 50-m permanent line transects were set at low and high environmental reefs to collect the percent of live coral cover, fish diversity and abundance, and fish trophic-functional groups based on diet and habitat use. Our results showed a significant rise in the percentage of live coral cover, the number of individual fish, the number of fish species, and species richness at both bays following the COVID-19 lockdown due to a crucial reduction in human activities on the reef. In addition, there were increases in the number of corallivore fishes belonging to Chaetodontidae and Pomacentridae families and a reduction of omnivorous fish at the fish-feeding tourist attraction reefs due during the COVID-19 lockdown due to reducing fish-feeding tourism. This indicated that restricted human activities and reduced anthropogenic stress on a coral reef may have substantial short-term impacts on reef fish diversity. Our insights could help designate guidelines to manage tourist impacts on coral reefs and aid in their prolonged persistence. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee C.E.J, Tehran, Iran.",

In U. rosea, surface mating is the main mating mode, and females incubate eggs inside their own burrows.We investigated 73 randomly selected burrows with chimneys (36 females, and 37 males). We observed that chimney and burrow characteristics, except for burrow/chimney diameter, were greater in females than in similar-sized males. The burrows were I- A nd J-shaped, with a higher number of J-shaped burrows in females and a higher number of I-shaped burrows in males. J-shaped burrows were longer and deeper, had greater volumes, and had higher and thicker chimneys, than I-shaped burrows. Chimney characteristics were positively correlated with burrow characteristics.

  "abstract": "This study investigated spatial and temporal variations on the coexistence of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex larvae in five subdistricts in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. We tested two main hypotheses on the spatial and temporal coexistence of mosquito larvae: (1) condition-specific competition and (2) spatial variation among the five subdistricts. We compared the number of positive houses, positive containers, mosquito coexistence during both the wet and dry seasons. The results showed that from a total of 1,072 positive containers collected in both seasons, Ae. albopictus larvae were found in the highest number of containers (745 containers), followed by containers with Ae. aegypti larvae (283 containers) and containers with Culex larvae (254 containers). During the wet season, there were higher numbers of positive houses, positive containers, and containers with only Ae. albopictus larvae than during the dry season. On the other hand, during the dry season when the water containers were very scarce, there were higher numbers of containers with Culex larvae, and containers held more than one type of mosquito larvae. This indicates that both temporal and spatial variations may contribute to the local coexistence of Aedes and Culex mosquito larvae species in Lansaka District areas in Thailand. © 2020 Malque Publishing.

  "abstract": "Parah (Elateriospermum tapos Blume) is a native species of southern Thailand, and is a dominant tree in Khao Nan National Park. There have been few studies of Parah seeds or of seedling establishment. Biotic and abiotic environmental factors interact with seeds and may affect the future of tree populations. This is the first study to determine the factors affecting seeds and seedlings of Parah trees in Khao Nan National Park, Thailand, during 2014 - 2016. We tested 3 factors: (1) parental tree diameter at breast height (DBH), (2) altitude, and (3) distance from the main road. We studied seeds collected from trees, seeds harvested by humans, seed predation, seeds left on the forest floor, and rotten seeds. We measured seed weight, seed size, seedling height, and seedling root collar diameter (RCD). Our results showed that the number of seeds and seedlings per tree, seed weight, seed size, seed harvesting, seed predation, seeds left on the forest floor, rotten seeds, and seedling height varied between the years of study. There was no difference in seeds harvested by humans from 2014 - 2016. The number of seeds per tree and seeds harvested by humans were positively associated with parental tree DBH in 2015 and 2016. The number of seeds left on the forest floor was positively associated with parental tree DBH, and distance from the main road, but was negatively associated with altitude, in 2015, and there was no association in 2016. The number of seeds predated by frugivores was positively associated with altitude in 2016. The number of seedlings per tree was positively associated with distance from the main road. Seedling height was positively associated with distance from the main road, and negatively associated with tree DBH in 2015 and altitude in both years. We found significant results which led to the conclusion that seed production and seeds harvested by humans were positively associated with parental tree size. © 2018, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "Aim: Seed predation and dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents are important for plant population dynamics and forest structure. In this study, the potential of red spiny rats (Maxomys surifer) as predators, dispersers and scatter-hoarders of Parah (Elateriospermum tapos) seeds was examined in Khao Nan National Park, Thailand. Methodology: One thousand Parah seeds and 100 rats were used in this experiment. Ten seeds with one rat were set inside a cage. Infrared videos of seed predation and dispersal by the rats were made from 9:00-10:00 p.m. afterwards, the numbers of seeds predated (predated, undamaged, and partially predated), dispersed (non-removed, displaced and removed) and scatter-hoarded were recorded. Results: The percentage of undamaged, predated and partially predated seeds, as well as of removed, non-removed, and displaced seeds differed significantly. In both males and females, most of the seeds were undamaged, followed by those predated and partially predated. Additionally, most of the seeds were not removed, followed by those removed and displaced. Both males (35%) and females (37%) scatter-hoarded seeds, and the seed numbers did not differ between sexes. Body weight of rats was positively correlated with the percentage of predated seeds and negatively correlated with the percentage of undamaged seeds, but not with the potentially viable, non-removed, displaced, or removed seeds. Interpretation: Red spiny rats act as predators, dispersers and scatter-hoarders of Parah seeds. It indicates that these rats may play an important role in Parah population dynamics. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).",

  "abstract": "We tested for the first time how Austruca bengali Crane, 1975 signaller males adjusted their waving rates based on receiver female body sizes and their distances. We video recorded the waving display of 46 males (9-12 mm carapace width) for 30 s, and counted their waving rate. Receiver females were categorised as small (8-10 mm carapace width) and large (>10 mm). Distances between males and females were categorised as short (≤12 cm) and long (>12 cm) distances. Our results indicate that males are able to measure distances and female sizes, and adjust their waving display by actively reducing waving rate (1) towards small females, as usually small females have lower fecundity compared to large ones and (2) towards females at very close distance because at this point, the females would make their mating decision, and thus males start to lead/hit the females towards their burrow rather than waving vigorously. © 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

  "abstract": "Investigating the time activity budgets of fiddler crabs is very important to determine the effects of sex and body size on allocating time for different activities. Few previous studies investigated the effects of sex and body size on time allocations in underground mating species. This study determines the effects of sex, size and their interaction on time allocations in a surface mating species (Tubuca rosea (Tweedie, 1937)). The surface activities of large and small, male and female crabs were video recorded. Afterwards time allocations for various activities (e.g., feeding, standing (vigilance), walking, inside burrows, grooming, burrowing, mating, and for males only, fighting and claw-waving) were calculated. All crabs spent most of their time on feeding than on other activities. Smaller crabs spent more time being vigilant, whereas larger crabs spent more time on courtship displays (grooming, and waving), and fighting. Between sexes, females spent more time standing, but less time on walking and grooming than males. Predation risk, reproductive maturation, breeding/non-breeding season, and energy conservation could be important factors for shaping time allocations in T. rosea. © 2019 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido.

  "abstract": "The aims of this study are to examine the effects of (1) socio-cultural practices of using different types of water storage containers, and (2) seasons, on the numbers of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus larvae in the five sub-districts of Lansaka district. We randomly selected 20 houses per sub-district per month, with a total of 600 households, and collected Aedes mosquito larvae from different types of containers (indoor/outdoor, natural/artificial, dark/light coloured, and with/without lids) during both the dry (March-May 2015) and wet (October-December 2015) seasons. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae found in each container were identified and counted. The larval indices (i.e., house index (HI), container index (CI), and Breteau index (BI)) were calculated for each sub-district, and for each season. Our results showed that socio-cultural practices of using different types of containers differed between sub-districts and seasons. Ae. albopictus larval indices were higher than Ae. aegypti larval indices in both seasons. Ae. albopictus larval indices were higher in the wet season than in the dry season; the opposite results were observed for Ae. aegypti. Ae. albopictus larvae were more commonly found in outdoor containers in both seasons, but were found to be more in light coloured and without lid containers during the dry season, whereas Ae. aegypti larvae were more often found in indoor containers in both seasons, but are found more in light coloured containers in the dry season. There were positive correlations between container numbers and mosquito larvae numbers in all sub-districts. These results indicate that seasons and water container types have strong effects on the breeding of Aedes mosquito larvae. This knowledge could be used to obtain a better understanding on how to take initiatives that could promote the prevention and control of dengue vectors. © 2018, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

  "abstract": "Real-time online coral sensor and climatic data are vital for long term ecological observatory research. It is difficult to maintain a continuous real-time online data stream using various underwater sensors feeding to a server. To solve this difficulty, we integrated an event detection and decision support system (DSS) to help researchers to make decisions about sensor maintenance and to proactively prevent system malfunctions. This paper describes the components of pre-processing data in-situ, using behavior learning from historical data, creating anomaly detection, and verifying sensor data. This online system is flexible, for both health monitoring and decision-making. When data loss or sensor malfunctions occur, then an automatic email will be sent to researchers, to show both sensor health and anomaly reports. Researchers will then make a decision on who will fix the problems, and plan for maintenance on site. The integrated decision support system and event detection uses various tools and techniques, such as Mathematica for analysis and open source software (PHP, MySQL, and Highcharts) for visualization. This is the first practical system that uses heterogeneous sensors integrated with flexible cloud storage, which shows both alerts regarding system health and anomaly reports through social media, and helps researchers in decision-making, in order to reduce maintenance time and costs, and to enable long term use of sensor data in order to expand understanding on climate change. © 2016, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "This study explored the spatio-temporal patterns of dengue infection in southern Thailand. Data on monthly-notified cases of dengue fever, over the period of January 1981- May 2014 were collected from the Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health. Weather data over the period of January 2007-May 2014 were obtained from the Thai Meteorological Department. Box and whisker plots were used to study the spatial temporal patterns of dengue incidence. Spearman correlation analysis and time-series adjusted Poisson regression analysis were performed to quantify the relationship between weather and the number of dengue cases. The results show that the highest dengue cases occurred in July in the Gulf of Thailand. Conversely, for the Andaman Sea, the highest dengue cases occurred in June in Phang-Nga, Phuket and Ranong provinces. Only Krabi province had the most dengue cases occurring in July. When we compared dengue transmission duration between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, we found that for the Andaman Sea, Trang province had the longest dengue transmission duration (i.e. June-September) and for the Gulf of Thailand, Nakhon Si Thammarat had the longest dengue transmission duration (i.e. June-September). The number of rainy days and relative humidity were the main predictors of dengue incidence by the Gulf of Thailand, while the amount of rainfall and the temperature were the main predictors of dengue incidence by the Andaman Sea. The time series Poisson regression models provided such goodness-of-fit that the correlation between observed and predicted numbers of dengue incidence exceeded 80%. These models could be used to optimise dengue prevention by predicting trends in dengue incidence. Accurate predictions, for even a few months, provide an invaluable opportunity to mount a vector control intervention or to prepare for hospital demand in the community. © 2016, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

Monthly water samples were collected from 15 river mouths during 2002-2011 and analysed for spatio-temporal variation. The results indicated that water quality at Bandon Bay varied spatially and temporally during the past ten years. Four pollution factors were identified: (1) nutrient, (2) organic matter, (3) salinity and buffering and (4) erosion factors. Discriminant analysis on spatial variables identified only four parameters - i.e. water depth, alkalinity, salinity, and temperature - to discriminate between 15 river mouths.

We observed 70 pairs of naturally engaged combats between residents and intruders, sampled 80 non-fighting males, and measured their body size, claw size, and handedness. We found that only larger males in the population were involved in combats.

The results showed no differences in crab density, sex ratio, and body size among the three distances. The percent moisture content at 2 m distance was higher than at 4 and 6 m, and the percentage organic matter at 2 m distance was higher than at 6 m distance. Burrows were shorter in length, shallower in depth, and smaller in volume at 2 m distance, but these measures increased with increasing distance from the river edge.

On the basis of video recordings of feeding motions and duration, and morphometric measurements of body size (measured as carapace width) and feeding claw size (measured as dactyl length and width), differences in feeding rate per crab and per feeding claw, feeding duration, and feeding claw size between sexes were studied with the main aim to test male ability to compensate for the loss of one functional feeding claw. Additionally, feeding rate of males and females of small and large size classes was studied. Furthermore, correlations between feeding rate and body size, as well as feeding claw size and body size were investigated. Results showed that increased feeding rate per feeding claw coupled with a larger feeding claw allowed males to compensate for the loss of one feeding claw. Smaller males and females fed faster than larger ones. There was a negative correlation between feeding rate and carapace width. Feeding duration did not vary between males and females of comparable size. A positive correlation was observed between feeding claw size and carapace width. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

Our results showed that males and females in HD were larger in size than those in LD. Since HD males were larger in size, they built higher quality burrows than males in LD.

  "abstract": "This study explored the impact of weather variability on the transmission of dengue fever in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. Data on monthly-notified cases of dengue fever, over the period of January 1981 - June 2012 were collected from the Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health. Weather data over the same period were obtained from the Thai Meteorological Department. Spearman correlation analysis and time-series adjusted Poisson regression analysis were performed to quantify the relationship between weather and the number of dengue cases. The results showed that maximum and minimum temperatures at a lag of zero months, the amount of rainfall, and relative humidity at a lag of two months were significant predictors of dengue incidence in Nakhon Si Thammarat. The time series Poisson regression model demonstrated goodness-of-fit with a correlation between observed and predicted number of dengue incidence rate of 91.82%. This model could be used to optimise dengue prevention by predicting trends in dengue incidence. Accurate predictions, for even a few months, provide an invaluable opportunity to mount a vector control intervention or to prepare for hospital demand in the community.",

  "abstract": "Background & objectives: Environmental factors including weather variables may play a significant role in the transmission of dengue. This study investigated the effect of seasonal variation on the abundance of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae and explored the impact of weather variability on dengue transmission in Sisaket, Thailand. Methods: The monthly mosquito larval surveys were carried out in urban and rural areas in Sisaket, Thailand from January to December 2010. Data on monthly-reported cases of dengue fever over the period 2004-2010 were obtained from the Ministry of Public Health. Weather data over the same period were obtained from the Thai Meteorological Department. Chi-square test was used to find the differences relating to seasonal variability, areas of study, and mosquito species factors using entomological survey data. Time series Poisson regression analysis was performed using data on monthly weather variables and dengue cases. Results: There were more Ae. aegypti larvae per household than Ae. albopictus larvae in the winter and rainy seasons. More Aedes larvae per household were found in the rainy season than in the winter and summer seasons. Relative humidity at a lag of one month and rainy days in the current month were significant predictors of dengue incidence in Sisaket. Interpretation & conclusions: Increased rain during the current month and less humidity during the previous month might trigger a higher incidence of dengue epidemic in Sisaket. The present findings suggest that the dengue incidence corresponds with the number of Aedes larvae. The seasonal patterns of dengue outbreaks coincide with the rainy season.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed at developing a predicting model on the incidence rate of dengue fever in four locations of Thailand - i.e. the northern region, Chiang Rai province, the northeastern region and Sisaket province - using time series analysis. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was performed using data on monthly incidence rate of dengue fever from 1981 to 2009, and validated using the monthly rate collected for the period January 2010 to October 2011. The results show that the SARIMA(1,0,1)(0,1,1)12 model is the most suitable model in all locations. The model for all locations indicated that the predicted dengue incidence rate and the actual dengue incidence rate matched reasonably well. The model was further validated by the Portmanteau test with no significant autocorrelation between residuals at different lag times. Our findings indicate that SARIMA model is a useful tool for monitoring dengue incidence in Thailand. Furthermore, this model can be applied to surveillance data for early warning systems for control and reduction of dengue transmission.",

  "abstract": "Population genetics has been recognized as a key component of policy development for fisheries and conservation management and aquaculture development. This study aims to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of native cobia (Rachycentron canadum) in the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea, establishing the existing population distributions and contributing information to aid in the development of policy, prior to extensive aquaculture development. Microsatellite analysis of natural cobia populations in these two ocean basins shows similar levels of gene diversity at 0.844 and 0.837, respectively. All populations and almost all microsatellite loci studied show significant heterozygote deficiency. Genetic differentiation between local populations is low and mostly not significant (RST = -0.0109 to 0.0066). The population shows no marked structure over the long geographic barrier of the Thai-Malay peninsula, either when analyzed using pairwise genetic differences or evaluated without predefined populations using STRUCTURE. Additionally, a Mantel test shows no evidence of isolation by distance between the population samples. The significant heterozygote deficiency at most of the loci studied could be explained by the possibility of null alleles. Alternatively, given the behavior of forming small spawning aggregations, seasonal migration, and hitchhiking on large marine animals, the population genetics could be complex. The population of cobia at each location in Thai waters may be inbred, as a result of breeding between relatives, which would reduce heterozygosity relative to Hardy-Weinberg frequencies, while some of these populations could be making long distance migrations followed by admixture between resident and transient groups. This migration would cause population homogeneity in allele frequencies on a larger geographic scale. The results suggest that fisheries management for this species should be considered at both national and international levels, and until the possibility of local adaptation is fully investigated, policy development should apply the precautionary principle to ensure the preservation of genetic diversity and the sustainability of local and regional fisheries. © 2012 The Author(s).",

  "abstract": "Parah (Elateriospermum tapos Blume) is a native species of southern Thailand. There are few studies of Parah clusters at Khao Nan National Park, Nakhon Si Thammarat, but no investigation of the locations and boundaries of this species has been undertaken. This study is the first attempt to use open standard Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to investigate Parah forest clusters. Park rangers used a Global Positioning System (GPS) device, a Garmin 76CSx, to survey Parah cluster boundaries during May - June 2011. The coordinates of the Parah boundary were analysed in MapSource and overlaid on a Google Earth map. The area of Parah clusters was then estimated. There are five main clusters of Parah forests at Khao Nan National Park: (1) Ban Na Phra Chao, (2) Ban Tub Namtao, (3) Ban Hok Phu, (4) Namtok Hin Toh site 1 and (5) Namtok Hin Toh site 2. The Parah cluster at Ban Tub Namtao was the largest Parah cluster with a total area of 410.08 hectares. The total area of the five main Parah forests was 810.24 hectares. The size distribution of Parah trees and its density was varied among Parah clusters.",

While advances are being made in collecting data, from automated sensors, sensor networks and so on, the same advances have yet to be made in the analysis and extraction of information from the data collected. There are advances in computing, modeling and visualization that can help but these require a new paradigm in how the observational data is stored, accessed and managed.

We found that SST of all study sites had significantly increased over the past 30 years, and coefficients of bimodality showed that distribution of SST would be bimodal distribution rather than unimodal distribution.

  "abstract": "This study investigated the prevalence of Aedes larvae in two different topographical areas (i.e. seaside and mountainous area) and in two faith-based communities (i.e. Buddhist and Muslims). Samples were collected by using the stratified simple random sampling with a total of 400 households from all communities in 31 sub-districts. The results showed that Aedes larvae were mostly found in artificial containers including water containers in bathrooms, potted plants, animal pans, concrete tanks and water jars. Ae. albopictus larvae were found in higher numbers in the seaside area than in the mountainous area. All three Aedes larval indices: Container Index (CI), House Index (HI) and Breteau Index (BI), indicated a high risk of DHF transmission in both locations and faith-based communities. We also found that the HI in Muslim households was more than in Buddhist households.",

We observed 100 pairs of males naturally engaged in fighting behaviour and recorded fighting duration and the identity of the winners. Fighting pairs tend to be larger than average males in a population. Larger males tend to win fights regardless of residency status. Fighting duration was shorter when the size asymmetry between fighting pairs was greater. Residency status had no effect on fighting outcome.",

Both processes, that drive the evolution and maintenance of male traits and female preferences, had an influence on male body size. Females preferred larger males as mates. Copulation time was shorter in cases where females were larger than males. Compared with rejected males, accepted males had greater carapace breadth and length.

Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus laid eggs in different container types depending on topographical areas. Ae. aegypti larvae were found most in preserved areca jars in mangrove and mountainous areas and in banana trees in rice paddy areas. Ae. albopictus larvae were found most in preserved areca jars in mangrove areas, in plant axils in rice paddy areas and in metal boxes in mountainous areas. Ae. albopictus larval indices were higher than Ae. aegypti larval indices in all three topographical areas. House index (HI) and Breteau index (BI) were not different in the three topographical areas but different between mosquito species. HI for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in all three topographical areas were greater than 10%, which indicated high risk of DHF transmission in these areas.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to develop a risk score to identify people at high risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the population of Chonburi, Thailand, and to compare this risk score with 2 previous predictive risk scores for T2DM. Data from 7,284 individuals aged ≥ 20 years were collected from the Thai population, using a cross-sectional analytical study method. A screening algorithm was developed based on the first half and validated in the second half of the study population. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for T2DM, by performing a predictive model in which only significant factors were included. Afterwards, our predictive model was compared with the other 2 predictive models, where risk scores were derived from Thai adults. Our results showed that significant predictive variables were age, BMI, hypertension, history of diabetes in parents or siblings, and marital status. A cutoff score of 9 out of 17 produced the optimal sums of sensitivity (74%) and specificity (97%). The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) was 0.969. Our predictive model had a higher AUC when compared to the other 2 models. When the risk score was applied, the predictive model selected 425 subjects who should undergo further testing for diagnosing diabetes and 3,259 subjects who should not. A simple T2DM risk score, based on a set of variables, can be used for the investigation of early intervention to delay or prevent T2DM in Thailand. © 2016 Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

We predicted that (1) burrows with chimneys (i.e., chimneys) would decrease intruder intrusion rates relative to burrows without chimneys (i.e., burrows), (2) intruders would take longer to locate and enter chimneys than burrows, (3) chimney owners would rebuild their chimneys the next day, and (4) females would build higher chimneys than males. We observed that intruders entered burrows more often than chimneys, and took longer time to locate and enter chimneys than burrows. More than 60% of the chimney owners rebuilt chimneys the following day. Crab carapace width was positively correlated with burrow diameter, and chimney diameter, height and width. Females built higher chimneys than males. This study shows that chimneys provide benefits to both sexes by reducing intruder intrusion rates, and by prolonging the intrusion time in burrows, especially in those built by females. © 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

The indirect method used a linear relationship to generate annual precipitation forecasts, a temporal disaggregation to generate daily precipitation and the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model to generate monthly streamflow. The accuracy of the forecasts was assessed using the coefficient of determination, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and the Hit score, and their economic value was evaluated using the cost/loss ratio method. The results revealed that the indirect method was slightly more effective than the direct method. However, the direct method achieved higher economic value in the majority of cost/loss situations, allowed for predictions with longer lead times and required less information. © 2018 IAHS.",

The situation of spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in businesses and labor departments having to adapt to survive by upgrading existing knowledge and adding new skills. Therefore, this research aims to describe components and models of necessary skills development for performance affecting dynamic capabilities and performance in a new normal era for human resources managers of five-star hotels in Phuket Province, which are crucial components in an increased corporation’s sustainability and performance in terms of personnel efficiency, assets, funds, and information. This research is quantitative, and research data was collected from a total of 384 human resource managers of five-star hotels. There was a mutual discussion of factor analysis and structural equation results with three human resources managers who have been successful for not less than seven years in their work. The components consisted of systematic consideration through the following causes: necessary skills; professional skills, work skills, and emotional skills, mediator variables; dynamic capabilities, and organizational performance. This research also discussed five guidelines for developing the necessary skills for performance. As various factors have affected the performance in the new normal era, the human resources executives of five-star hotels in Phuket province should apply them and consider them together with their business plans for setting the strategic plan of organizational management, management, administrative, and human resources development. © Authors retain all copyrights.",

The sample consisted of 126 patients with stable COPD attending the out-patient pulmonary clinic of Thasala hospital. The patients were assessed for HRQL by the Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), age, BMI, depression, dyspnea by the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), exercise capacity by the 6 min walk distance (6MWD), and admission. The results found that 84% of patients were male, with a mean age of 69.6 years, FEV1 70 (9.6)% predicted, BMI 21.9 (4.4) and 6MWD 259.8 (97.9). The HRQL indicated mild impairment: symptoms 47.1 (22.4), activity 49.7 (30.3), impact 41.9 (21.2) and total scores of 45.1 (21.7). The regression analysis showed that HRQL was significantly associated with exercise capacity, depression, and MRC dyspnea respectively (R2 = 0.492, p < 0.01). Therefore, stable COPD patients should be assessed and motivated to pulmonary rehabilitation for promoting clinical outcomes and also improving their HRQL. © 2019, Walailak University.

Eighteen women aged 46-55years, who lived in the southern Thailand and identified themselves as experiencing physiological changes, participated in the study. Five themes became apparent during the analysis of the women's stories: changing in midlife, sensing normal phenomena, searching for explanation, sense of loss, and self-managing. This study reveals that Thai women's traditional ties to Buddhism play a major role in their acceptance of midlife as part of the life cycle; an event that is best managed with support from other women. Health professionals should reconsider their understanding of women's midlife experiences in order to provide effective healthcare support to Thai women. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Depression-related suicide appears to be increasing among older people in a number of countries and occurs consistently in multicultural contexts and among various religious communities. In this study we explored and described the experiences of eight older Thai-Muslims with a history of severe depression and suicide attempts who lived in southern Thailand. The phenomenological method of Colazzi was used to gather, analyze and present data and we employed in-depth interviews. Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed four themes that stood out as figural for the participants: (a) “death is freedom from life”, (b) “loss and loneliness leads to suicide”, (c) “a healing approach through Islamic beliefs”, and (d) “need someone to support”. The findings revealed that the participants generally contemplate suicide in a state of abject misery. Nurse-client therapeutic relationships are important and meaningful for creating personal trust, safety and confidence through being with such people, and collaborating with them to make various choices, to enhance their self-value and touch their inner life-energy. In the healing process, nurses should consider developing positive connections, attempting to alleviate pain and suffering, and providing them with effective support in an acceptable Islamic manner. © 2019, Thailand Nursing and Midwifery Council.

  "abstract": "Background: Psychiatric problems have been a growing and significant public health challenge. Community-based psychiatric services have been shown to contribute to the improvement of health and social-related outcomes, but with limited specialists in this field. Consequently, Thailand has integrated these services into the primary care system delivered by community nurses working in primary care units (PCUs). Aim: To describe the experiences of psychiatric patients in receiving services provided by non-specialist community nurses. Method: A phenomenological approach was used. Eleven psychiatric patients with 10 major depressive disorders and 1 with schizophrenia were interviewed. The results were evaluated using thematic content analysis. Results: The results revealed two main themes as barriers and facilitators experienced in receiving services from community nurses. Conclusion: Community-based services should be concerned about developing psychiatric nursing competency for community nurses to extend basic services to patients in communities and to assist family members. © The Author(s) 2021.",

A case study was used to present the psychosocial support provided by a health volunteer to an older adult suffering from depression and attempted suicide. Content analysis was applied to analyze the data. The results revealed that the psychosocial support given by the health volunteer consisted of 4 processes; 1) support and motivation to keep alive, 2) encouragement for a new life, 3) empowerment for life change, and 4) evaluation of the change process. These processes not only help mitigate patients’ symptoms of depression and possible suicide risks but also prove to promote psychological well-being.

  "abstract": "Depression in older adults has remained 1 of the major detrimental public health problems both worldwide and in Thailand. Among the myriad healing approaches, mental attachment on the basis of grandchildren’s love language is favorably perceived by Thai older adults with depression. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to evaluate the effects of grandchildren’s love language program on reducing depression among Thai older adults. Eighty Thai older adults with mild to moderate depression levels received the so-called “Love Language of Grandchildren Program” (n = 40) and usual care (n = 40). The Nine-Question Scale (9Q) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) were distributed at the pre-and post-treatment and at the 12 and 24-week of the follow-ups. The treatment effectiveness was evaluated by using Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA). The 9Q and HRSD scores revealed a significantly neutralized depression for those in love language of grandchildren program and, on the other hand, no decline was observed in the usual care’s participants. Love language of grandchildren program effectively reduced 9Q and HRSD symptoms of emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physical conditions respectively. It was also more effective than the usual care in reducing mild to moderate symptoms of depression (p < 0.05). The findings provide better understanding on how grandchildren approach to prevent depression for Thai older adults in a family and community, and can be used to guide further capacity development for grandchildren who provide helping to this group. © 2020, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "Background Self-care is essential for treating hypertension by lowering and controlling blood pressure, to ultimately reduce cardiovascular disease. A valid and reliable hypertension self-care measure is needed for the Thai population. Objective The aim of this study was to translate a cross-cultural adaptation of the Self-care of Hypertension Inventory (SC-HI) into Thai and conduct a pretest of the Thai SC-HI (version 2.0). Methods We performed a methodological study. The stepped approach included translation of the original version of the SC-HI into Thai (forward), synthesis of translation, translation of the Thai version back to English, expert committee review, and pretesting. Pretest phase for feasibility, interobserver agreement, and temporal stability tests were performed in 140 patients with hypertension. Results Translation equivalence was obtained between the Thai and the original US versions. The item-level content validity index was rated by 9 experts; the relevance, clarity, simplicity, and ambiguity criteria were all 1.00. Similarly, the scale-level content validity indices were 1.00 for the overall instrument and the self-care maintenance, self-care management, and self-care confidence scales. The item-level intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) had a range of 0.97 to 1.00 for interobserver agreement and 0.95 to 1.00 for test-retest, respectively. The interobserver ICCs were 0.99 for the total scale and 3 separate scales. The test-retest ICCs were 0.99 for the total scale, with a range of 0.97 to 0.99 for the three separate scales. Conclusion The process of cross-cultural adaptation warranted validity and reliability testing of the Thai SC-HI. Psychometric testing of this instrument is needed for evaluation in a large sample of individuals with hypertension.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Background: Despite a common view that women are better at self-care, there is very little evidence to support or challenge this perspective in the heart failure (HF) population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if there are cross-cultural gender differences in self-reported HF self-care and to describe gender differences in the determinants of HF self-care. Design, setting, and participants: A secondary analysis was completed of cross-sectional study data collected on 2082 adults with chronic HF from the United States, Australia and Thailand. Methods: Comparisons were made between men and women regarding self-care maintenance, management and confidence as assessed by the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index, as well as the proportion of subjects engaged in adequate self-care. Multivariate comparisons were made to determine if gender explained sufficient variance in HF self-care and the likelihood of reporting adequate self-care, controlling for nine model covariates. Results: The sample was comprised of 1306 men and 776 women. Most (73.5%) had systolic or mixed systolic and diastolic HF and 45% had New York Heart Association class III or IV HF. Although small and clinically insignificant gender differences were found in self-care maintenance, gender was not a determinant of any aspect of HF self-care in multivariate models. Married women were 37% less likely to report adequate self-care maintenance than unmarried women. Comorbidities only influenced the HF self-care of men. Being newly diagnosed with HF also primarily affected men. Patients with diastolic HF (predominantly women) had poorer self-care maintenance and less confidence in self-care. Conclusion: Differences in HF self-care are attributable to factors other than gender; however, there are several gender-specific determinants of HF self-care that help identify patients at risk for practicing poor self-care. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  "abstract": "Objective: Clinicians worldwide seek to educate and support heart failure patients to engage in self-care. We aimed to describe self-care behaviors of patients from 15 countries across three continents. Methods: Data on self-care were pooled from 5964 heart failure patients from the United States, Europe, Australasia and South America. Data on self-care were collected with the Self-care of Heart Failure Index or the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale. Results: In all the samples, most patients reported taking their medications as prescribed but exercise and weight monitoring were low. In 14 of the 22 samples, more than 50% of the patients reported low exercise levels. In 16 samples, less than half of the patients weighed themselves regularly, with large differences among the countries. Self-care with regard to receiving an annual flu shot and following a low sodium diet varied most across the countries. Conclusion: Self-care behaviors are sub-optimal in heart failure patients and need to be improved worldwide. Practice implications: Interventions that focus on specific self-care behaviors may be more effective than general educational programs. Changes in some health care systems and national policies are needed to support patients with heart failure to increase their self-care behavior. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Purpose: Self-care is essential for hypertensive individuals to promote optimal health and illness treatment. We developed the Thai Self-Care of Hypertension Inventory (SC-HI) version 2.0 from the original US version using a multi-stage approach for cross-cultural adaptation. Scales previously studied outside a US context had different dimensions and factor solutions. Therefore, we examined the Thai SC-HI's factorial validity, construct validity, and internal reliability within a Thai context. Methods: We administered a cross-sectional survey with hypertensive patients in 10 primary care settings, and conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on two sets of separate samples from each of five sites to examine the model's factorial validity and construct validity. We estimated scale reliability with Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients. Results: Participants were predominantly female, older adults, with mean age 66 years (SD = 11.94; range 36–97 years). The self-care maintenance scale had three factors and demonstrated good fit when the error covariances were respecified. The two-factor self-care management scale had different factorial solutions compared to previous models. The CFA result showed good fit indices for the Thai, original US, and Brazilian models. The self-care confidence scale was unidimensional, with partially supported fit indices that improved after we respecified the error covariances. Reliability coefficients estimated by difference methods were nearly equal: slightly lower than desired for self-care maintenance (.68–.70) and inadequate for self-care management (.62–.65); self-care confidence reliability was adequate (.89–.90). Conclusion: The Thai SC-HI has good psychometric characteristics and reflects the original instrument's theoretical basis. © 2022",

  "abstract": "Background: Poor balance is a major risk factor for falls and fear of falling, and exercise which specifically challenges balance is the most effective intervention for preventing falls. This cohort study described the effects of participation in a 3-month simple home-based balancing training program on measures of balance performances and fear of falling in Thai older adults. Methods: The participants included 104 older adults who were living in a rural area of Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, Thailand. The exercise group participated in a 3-month simple home-based balancing training program by trained nurses. Balance was measured by a functional reach test and timed up-and-go test. Fear of falling was measured by Thai Falls Efficacy Scale-International (Thai FES-I). Results: After 12 weeks of balance training, the participants in the exercise group showed a significant difference when compared to baselines for both the functional reach test and timed up-and-go test. The results also showed that the exercise group performed significantly better than the control group in the functional reach test and timed up-and-go test after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. In addition, fear of falling was reduced in the exercise group after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Conclusion: The simple home-based balance training program led by trained nurses is feasible for rural older adults and was safe, effective, and acceptable to older adults and healthcare providers.

To do so, it explores definitions of quality of life, outlines the literature on the effect of HF on quality of life, and ends by summarizing what is known about the effect of interventions on quality of life in persons with HF. The common dimensions of quality of life in all the models reviewed are physical, emotional, and social function. The chapter further discusses the impact of HF on each of these dimensions. The physical dimension includes biological issues or illness characteristics, symptoms, and functional status. The emotional dimension includes the psychological response to HF. Social functioning includes sociodemographic factors, including cultural and environmental aspects. Some evidence suggests that optimal medical therapy and perhaps disease management can improve quality of life, but many of the studies are limited by a failure to define the construct and measure it in its complexity. © Oxford University Press, 2008.

  "abstract": "Background: Over the last two decades, the understanding of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has expanded in Asian countries. Despite this progress, there have been limited investigations into sex-based differences in the development of CVD and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). Aim: We investigated whether males and females with hypertension had different risks of developing CVD and CVRFs. Methods: We used a stratified multi-stage sampling design involving 15 primary care centers in Thailand. We recruited 1,448 individuals aged 35–74 years old. The Framingham cardiovascular risk algorithm was used to determine the risk of CVD development. Results: Female patients were overall more likely to have lower CVD risk scores. However, they demonstrated higher scores in the moderate-risk (p < 0.001) and high-risk (p < 0.001) groups as compared with males. One in four females was at a high risk of developing CVD. Females had higher rates of all CVRFs against males across sub-risk groups, with the highest odds ratio observed in the high-risk group, which persisted after adjusting for covariations. Overall, female patients had higher rates of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and abdominal obesity as compared with males. Females in the overall group had a lower prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension than males, in contrast to the high-risk group. Female patients also had a lower prevalence of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption than males. Conclusion: There is evidence of sex-based differences in the risk of CVD development in hypertensive individuals. The interaction of CVRFs with a high risk of developing CVD was noted in females. © 2023",

  "abstract": "Background: Little is known about the relationship between self-care in heart failure (HF) and outcomes like health status. The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between HF self-care and Short Form-36 (SF-36) health status domains. Methods and results: A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected on 400 HF patients living in southern Thailand was completed using bivariate comparisons and hierarchical multiple regression modeling. Thai population norm-based SF-36 scores and Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) scores were used in the analysis. The sample was in older adulthood (65.7 ± 13.8 years), a slight majority of subjects were male (52%); the majority of subjects (62%) had class III or IV HF. Each health domain was low in this sample compared to the general population. SCHFI maintenance and confidence scores were correlated significantly with each health status domain. SCHFI scores explained a significant amount of variance all domains, both in bivariate and multivariate models, except social functioning. In multivariate models, higher levels of self-care were associated with better health in certain domains, but only when both SCFHI management and confidence were high. Conclusion: Improving HF self-care may be a mechanism through which future interventions can improve health in this population. © 2009 European Society of Cardiology.",

  "abstract": "Objectives: We aimed to examine the characteristics of maladaptive fall risk appraisal (FRA), discrepancies between physical and perceived-fall risk, and their associations with falls. Methods: Fall risk appraisal was determined using the full-tandem stand test as an objective measure and the Fall Efficacy Scale-International as a subjective measure, and 433 adults aged ≥60 years from Thailand were classified into four groups: irrational (low physical/high perceived risk), incongruent (high physical/low perceived risk), congruent (high physical/high perceived risk) and rational (low physical/low perceived risk) FRAs. Results: Only 20.8% of adults aged ≥60 years had rational FRA. The rest of the participants had either irrational (57.3%) or incongruent (2.3%), or congruent (19.6%) FRAs. Approximately 74% of those with congruent FRA reported experiencing a fall last year, followed by incongruent (60%), irrational (41.1%), and rational FRAs (27.8%, p < .001). After covariates adjustment, participants with congruent FRA were 3.06 times more likely of falling than those with rational FRA (p = .011). Conclusions: Maladaptive FRA is highly prevalent among adults aged ≥60. Identifying maladaptive FRA is essential for ensuring that adults aged ≥60 receiving early treatment associated with falls. Clinical implications: Preventing a transition from rational to irrational, incongruent, and congruent fall risk appraisals is vital to prevent falls and mitigate this problematic health condition. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

  "abstract": "To develop a model of healthy aging from the perspective of Thais, a grounded theory approach, including in-depth interviews and focus groups, was used. A purposive sample of 39 community-dwelling adults aged 40-85 years old was interviewed. The Thai healthy aging model composed of three themes: normality, nature, and dharma. In Thai, they are called tham-ma-da, tham-ma-chat, and tham-ma, or \"Thai 3Ts\". The theme of normality encompasses subthemes of staying physically active by being involved in plenty of physical activities, and being mentally active with creative and thoughtful hobbies and work. The theme of nature encompasses subthemes of living simply and being careful with money. The theme of dharma encompasses subthemes of enjoyment through helping family and participating in community activities, staying away from stress and worries by talking openly and honestly with someone, making merit, and helping other people without expecting anything in return. A greater understanding of healthy aging is a benefit for older adults and healthcare providers in an intervention-design process. Research can contribute valuable information to shape policy for healthy aging as well. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Background This cross-sectional study was conducted to examine prevalence of fear of falling and their association with measures of health conditions, functional impairment and activities of daily living. Methods The data were collected from 386 Thai community-dwelling adults aged 60 or older during July–December 2010. Fear of falling was measured with a single-item instrument. Participants were asked about basic activities of daily living by using the modified Barthel ADL and they were assessed functional capacities including a balance test and visual acuity test. The data of chronic diseases and the number of medications were collected by reviewing the patients’ medical records. Results Half of the older adults reported a fear of falling sometime, and 36% expressed that they very often had a fear of falling. Fear of falling had highly significant relationships with perceived general health, visual impairment, mobility impairment, balance impairment, stroke, hypertension, antihypertensive drug, number of medications, history of falls, and activities of daily living. In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with fear of falling were balance impairment (OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.74–5.67, P < 0.001), illiteracy (OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.08–4.41), female gender (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.08–3.23), and poor general health perception (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.11–2.84). Conclusion Identifying the risk factors of fear of falling can help health care providers developing a screening program and may be useful in developing multidimensional strategies which focus on improving balance performance, literacy, activities of daily living and health perception. © 2017",

Methods and Results: A total of 2082 adults from 2 developed (United States and Australia) and 2 developing countries (Thailand and Mexico) were studied in a descriptive, comparative study. Self-care was measured using the Self-Care of HF Index, which provided scores on self-care maintenance, management, and confidence. Data were analyzed using regression analysis after demographic (age, gender, education), clinical (functional status, experience with the diagnosis, comorbid conditions), and setting of enrollment (hospital or clinic) differences were controlled. When adequate self-care was defined as a standardized score ≥70%, self-care was inadequate in most scales in most groups. Self-care maintenance was highest in the Australian sample and lowest in the Thai sample (P < .001). Self-care management was highest in the US sample and lowest in the Thai sample (P < .001). Self-care confidence was highest in the Mexican sample and lowest in the Thai sample (P < .001). Determinants differed for the three types of self-care (eg, experience with HF was associated only with self-care maintenance). Conclusion: Interventions aimed at improving self-care are greatly needed in both the developed and the developing countries studied. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test the causal relationships among the components of sociodemographic (age, gender, education, and income), illness characteristics (duration of illness, severity of illness, and comorbid diseases), and self-management ability, and health status in the model of health status of patients with heart failure (HSHF). DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were 400 heart failure patients hospitalized or attending an out patient clinic at six hospitals in southern Thailand. A survey-interview method was used for data collection. Questionnaires were related to study factors including sociodemographics, duration of illness, the New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA-FC), the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI), the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). The relationship of the study variables was tested and modified under the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique by using LISREL. RESULTS: The initial hypothesized model did not fit the data. The modified model adequately fit the data and accounted for 64% of the variance in health status. Age had a direct negative effect on health status (β = -0.20, P < 0.01) and had an indirect negative effect on health status through self-management ability, severity of illness and comorbid disease (β = -0.13, P < 0.01). Education had a direct positive effect on health status (β = 0.12, P < 0.01). Gender and income had indirect negative effects on health status through severity of illness (β = -0.05; -0.05, P < 0.05). Duration of illness had an indirect positive effect on health status through self-management ability (β = 0.09, P < 0.05). Severity of illness and comorbid disease had a direct negative effect on health status (β = -0.31; -0.16, P < 0.01, respectively) and indirect negative effect on health status through self-management ability (β = -0.06; -0.05, P < 0.05, respectively). Self-management ability had a direct positive effect on health status (β = 0.38, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This model provides a guideline for explaining and predicting health status of patients with heart failure. Continuity care programs promoting self-management ability should be developed and implemented both in hospital-based and home-based settings in order to improve health status. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",

The results showed that OSL formed by pure adhesive or hybrid adhesives (3 blends: 25:75, 50:50 and 75:25) had properties that pass the CSA 0437.1 standards, such as (1) modulus of rupture, (2) modulus of elasticity, and (3) internal bond strength. However, the thickness swelling and bond durability of OSL formed by pure MDI failed to pass the standards, while those formed by pure PF or hybrid adhesives passed. Among the three blends of adhesives, the blend 75:25 (PF: MDI) gave the best properties while ratio of 50:50 gave the worst properties, especially internal bond strength due to the phase separation of both adhesives. In addition, the modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity in the \"edgewise\" direction were higher than those in the \"flatwise\" direction. In the edgewise direction, load is transferred in the direction of width of strand that is large while in the flatwise direction, load is transferred in the direction of thickness of strand which is small.",

Peel energies were superposed to form mastercurves using shift factors, aT, in accord with the universal WLF equation. When peeled at intermediate reduced rates, RaT, failure was cohesive within the SBR 1502, while at sufficiently high or low RaT interfacial separation between the rubber and PET occurred. These results markedly contrast with those found by Gent and Petrich using similar testpieces with another type of rubber, SBR 1513. They found cohesive failure at sufficiently low RaT and interfacial failure when RaT was high. The different behavior of the two elastomers is attributed to stronger interfacial attraction with SBR 1513 and its lower strength. General considerations governing the locus of failure during peel adhesion testing are discussed.",

The egg tray treated with the vapor phase of 40 µg/g clove oil and eugenol/eugenyl acetate combination (7:1 ratio) together with UV-C radiation exhibited activity against all pathogenic bacteria and extended the shelf life of eggs by approximately fivefold. The eggs stored in the treated egg tray exhibited good quality were reported. The synergic effect of the two main components (eugenol/eugenyl acetate at 7:1) in the vapor phase following UV radiation was found to be the key factor of the increased antibacterial activity of the clove oil vapor. Practical applications: In the paper egg tray industry, this technique can be easily applied in a large-scale production of trays, thus, enabling the delivery of microbiologically safe eggs to consumers. In addition, this technique can be applied by spraying into the egg tray. Subsequently, the egg tray is exposed to UV-C radiation to enhance the antibacterial activity of essential oil, then, the eggs are placed on the egg trays. This process helps inhibit bacterial growth during delivery to consumers. This is very helpful from farm to fork. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

  "abstract": "The generation of drying stress within the lumber from the trunk of a rubber tree prepared from different locations (radial distance up to 110 mm and height up to 4 m) has been investigated in real-time by using a restoring force measurement on half-split specimens. Drying was performed at constant dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures of 90 and 60 °C, respectively. The entire restoring force profiles do not vary significantly with height. In addition, before and after the reversal of stress, the force profiles are largely similar and the maximum negative and positive forces are approximately equal regardless of wood locations within the tree trunk. However in the radial direction, the process of stress reversal consisting of two negative force maxima appears to proceed slower in the inner juvenile wood than in the outer mature wood. Upon water immersion of the specimens for 4 months, the second negative force maximum gradually disappears and the force profiles with a shorter stress reversal period become less sensitive to the wood locations. An examination of the drying curves in the second stage of drying during stress reversal also indicates a slower migration of bound water out of the lumber in the juvenile wood compared to that in the mature wood. The drying is also faster in the water-immersed specimens. It is concluded that variability of the internal stress within the trunk of a rubber tree originated from the role of cell wall amorphous constituents and cell wall extractives on creep property and the movement of bound water within the wood cell wall during drying. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

  "abstract": "The effect of hydrothermal treatment at various temperatures (100 to 160 °C) and treatment times (30 to 720 minutes) on color changes (ΔE*), equilibrium moisture content (EMC), tensile strength (TS), shear strength (SS), brown-rot fungal decay mass loss (FML), and termite attack score (TAS) of rubberwood was examined. Response surface methodology (RSM) with a two-factor, four level (42) full factorial was employed. The mathematical models describing those properties as functions of treatment temperature and logarithm of treatment time were obtained. Hydrothermal treatment adversely and positively influenced mechanical properties (TS and SS) and durability (FML and TAS), respectively, of rubberwood. Strong correlations between ΔE*, TS, SS, and FML of hydrothermally treated rubberwood, proposed to be a consequence of degradation of hemicelluloses, were observed. Finally, ΔE* proved to be a good indicator of TS, SS, and FML but not that of EMC and TAS of hydrothermally treated rubberwood.",

  "abstract": "The structure and conductivity of mixtures of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with a molecular weight (MW) of 4 000 000 and KSCN vary with salt concentrations. The PEO-KSCN material of a molar ratio ethylene oxide unit to cation (O/K+) of 16/1 has low conductivity, and its crystal structure is similar to that of pure PEO, but with a lower crystallinity and melting point. The 8/1 material shows a high conductivity and exhibits an almost completely amorphous state, but the 4/1 material has a very low conductivity and a completely different crystal structure with a very high melting temperature. Mixed salt (LiSCN-NaClO4) systems increase the conductivity. It is suggested that these results can be explained in terms of molecular disorder in the PEO-salt phase, configurational entropy and/or degree of salt dissociation. Mixed anions (KSCN-KI) can also increase conductivity in systems having a high proportion of the SCN- ion. PEOs with a MW of 600 and 18 500 show a possible application as plasticizers to increase conductivity, due, in part, to the higher content of hydroxyl end-groups to dissociate the salt into free ions and, in part, to the lower glass transition temperature (Tg). PEO (MW 600) gives a better result than PEO (AW 18 500) at the same proportion in the two MW systems. A blend of three molecular weights (4 000 000, 18 500 and 600) has a higher conductivity and a lower crystallinity than do blends of two molecular weights. These phenomena are discussed in terms of random coil behaviour or the lack of it for the lower molecular weight species. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Due to a current overabundance of crude glycerol produced from the biodiesel industry, the compound has the potential to be used as an inexpensive carbon source for growing the green microalga Haematococcus pluvialis (H. pluvialis), the richest source of natural astaxanthin (ATX). In order to investigate the practical use of crude glycerol, microalgal cultures were grown mixotrophically and heterotrophically in BG11 medium with the supplementation of refined crude glycerol, a mixture of glycerol and ethanol, under 2, 5 and 7 g L-1, using photoautotrophic cultivation as a control. H. pluvialis green-stage growth and red-stage ATX accumulation were effectively facilitated by mixotrophic conditions, with the highest µ of 0.27 ± 0.03 day-1 and the highest ATX content of (3.5 ± 0.4 % wt) (both observed under 7 g glycerol L-1). In contrast, growth was completely inhibited under heterotrophic conditions. Under repeated fed-batch operation, the exponential growth phase, during green-stage mixotrophic cultivation, was significantly extended from 5 days (in batch) to 24 days, making biomass yield of 1.86 ± 0.06 g DCW L-1 (around 2.6-fold higher). Monitoring of substrates (glycerol, ethanol and nitrate) in the broth was carried out and subsequently suggested that further optimization of media could be made. © 2021, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higher-value products, such as cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), may be produced from lignocellulosic agroindustrial residues, such as oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) fibers that are presently underutilized or discarded. Recovery of cellulose from EFB and its conversion of CMC are discussed as methods of creating value and reducing the environmental impact of EFB. RESULTS: Cellulose was recovered from EFB fibers and converted to water soluble CMC. Cellulose isolation used a two-step sequential treatment involving peracetic acid (PA) (50 g dry EFB L−1 PA, 35 °C, 9 h) for initial delignification, and then alkaline peroxide (AP) (50 g delignified-EFB L−1 AP, 45 °C, 12 h). This treatment removed 91.5% of lignin in the original EFB fiber. The recovered solids, designated as cellulose-EFB, were comprised of 83.7 ± 3.4% cellulose, 5.6 ± 0.3% hemicellulose, 1.7 ± 0.0% lignin, and 1.7 ± 0.1% ash. A two-step process with an initial alkalization {3 g cellulose-EFB in 99 mL solvent [10:1 by vol mixture of ethanol (95%) and 35% NaOH], 30 °C, 2 h} followed by etherification was used to convert cellulose-EFB to CMC sodium salt. The conversion yield was 50% of the theoretical maximum. CONCLUSION: The best conditions for preparing CMC from cellulose-EFB were a 2 h treatment with 35% (wt/vol) NaOH during alkalization at 30 °C, followed by etherification at 55 °C. The CMC had a degree of substitution of 0.16 and a water solubility of 6.8 g L−1 at 30 °C. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry",

  "abstract": "Nutritionally enhanced probioticated whole pineapple juice (WPJ, comprising juice of pineapple pulp and peel) beverages were produced by fermentation of WPJ with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum WU-P19. The 12 h fermented juice contained between 2.1 × 109 and 3.7 × 109 live cells of the probiotic per milliliter, depending on the beverage formulation. The beverage had a pH of around 4.1 and a lactic acid content of ~12.8 g L−1. It had a total sugar (glucose, sucrose, fructose, maltose) content of ~100.2 g L−1. During fermentation, some of the initial glucose and fructose were consumed by the probiotic, but sucrose and maltose were not consumed. The original WPJ was free of vitamin B12, but fermentation enhanced vitamin B12 content (~19.5 mg L−1). In addition, fermentation enhanced the concentrations of vitamins B2, B3, and B6, but the bacterium consumed some of the vitamin B1 originally present. From a nutritional perspective, the final probioticated beverage was a good source of vitamin B12, vitamin C and vitamin B6. In addition, it contained nutritionally useful levels of vitamins B1, B2, and B3. The calorific value of the final beverage was 56.94 kcal per 100 mL. The product was stable during 21-day refrigerated (4◦ C) storage. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

  "abstract": "Samples of fermented herbs were used to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Of a total of 19 isolates, eight were resistant both to gastric acid and bile salts (glycocholic acid, GCA; taurocholic acid, TCA; glycodeoxycholic acid, GDCA; and taurodeoxycholic acid, TDCA). Most isolates exhibited a pH-dependent surface hydrophobicity: a pH of 4 conferred a greater hydrophobicity compared to a pH of 7. Based on the hydrophobicity characteristics, the LAB isolate WU-P19 from the traditional fermented herb Oroxylum indicum was selected for further study. WU-P19 was identified as Lactobacillus plantarum WU-P19. The presence of bile salts GCA and GDCA in the culture medium induced production of the relevant bile salt hydrolase. Relative to controls, the presence of the bile salts in the culture medium affected the carbon and nitrogen contents of the cells and their hydrophobicity. Cells grown in a medium free of bile salts were morphologically different to cells grown in the presence of GCA and GDCA. WU-P19 was resistant to several antibiotics. It produced β-galactosidase and inhibited growth of the tested pathogenic bacteria at various levels. In vitro, L. plantarum WU-P19 adapted well to conditions typical of the various zones of the human gastrointestinal tract. In view of the promising results, in vivo evaluations are planned for the isolate WU-P19. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and the University of Milan.",

  "abstract": "Abstract: Biopolymers from sterilizer condensate (BSC) and decanter effluent (BDE) of palm oil mill were recovered and characterized compared to the biopolymer from commercial xylan (BCX) prior to hydrogel production. They contained 83–90% hemicellulose with 67–79% xylose. They were water soluble and had two sizes (large and small) of molecular weight with polydispersity about 1.7 except BDE-S (1.04). The functional groups (by FT-IR) of the BSC and BDE were comparable with those of BCX. Biological activity of the BSC and BDE revealed that they were inactive on antimicrobial test, anti-cancer test and non-cytotoxicity but only BSC exhibited cytotoxicity against human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) ATCC HB-8065. All biopolymers were used for preparation of hydrogels by modified with maleic anhydride (MA), then blended with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) at various ratios. The optimum formula (F) giving the maximum swelling degree and/or tensile strength for BSC-, BDE- and BCX- hydrogel were F11, F17 and F35, respectively. These three selected complex hydrogels possessed cytotoxicity activity against normal cells but only the BDE- and BCX-hydrogels (F17 and F35) exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Therefore, the biopolymer (BSC) and the complex hydrogels (from BSC and BDE) had a potential for biomedical application.

  "abstract": "Photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides S10 was grown photoheterotrophically to produce hydrogen in three types of culture vessels having very different surface-to-volume ratios (S). The aim was to investigate the effect of the culture system geometry (low-aspect ratio cylindrical geometry, a rectangular or flat bottle geometry, and a tubular loop) on growth and hydrogen production as the culture vessel geometry affects the average internal irradiance. A mixed carbon substrate produced by hydrolysis of oil palm empty fruit bunch fibers was used to grow the bacterium and produce hydrogen. Internal average irradiance was shown to affect growth and hydrogen production. A tubular photobioreactor with a high surface area to culture volume ratio (S = 181.7 m−1) proved to be the best culture system for producing hydrogen at a high rate. In contrast, the highest value of the maximum specific growth rate occurred in the relatively poorly lit culture of the cylindrical vessel with a comparatively low surface-to-volume ratio (S = 52.3 m−1). The result suggests that irradiance regimen is a key factor controlling the switch from biomass production to hydrogen production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "Production of hydrogen by the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides was compared in continuously operated tubular photobioreactors illuminated by natural outdoor sunlight (0.15–66 klux; diurnal cycle) and constant indoor artificial light (10 klux; tungsten lamps). In both cases the operating temperature was 35 °C and the organic carbon source was an acid hydrolysate of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB), an agroindustrial waste. In the outdoor photobioreactor, under the best production conditions, the daytime feeding rate of the mixed carbon substrate was 48 mL h−1 and the average pseudo-steady state hydrogen production rate was 36 mL H2 L−1 medium h−1. The cumulative hydrogen production was 430 mL H2 L−1 medium. For the indoor photobioreactor fed at the same rate as the outdoor system, the steady state average hydrogen production rate was 43 mL H2 L−1 h−1 and the cumulative hydrogen production was 517 mL H2 L−1 medium. Reducing the feed rate to less than 48 mL h−1, enhanced the biomass concentration, but reduced hydrogen production in both bioreactors. The sunlight-based cumulative hydrogen production was only about 17% less compared to the artificially lit system, but required only 22% of the electrical energy. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",

  "abstract": "The green microalga Chlorella sp. TISTR 8990 was grown heterotrophically in the dark using various concentrations of a basal glucose medium with a carbon-to-nitrogen mass ratio of 29:1. The final biomass concentration and the rate of growth were highest in the fivefold concentrated basal glucose medium (25 g L−1 glucose, 2.5 g L−1 KNO3) in batch operations. Improving oxygen transfer in the culture by increasing the agitation rate and decreasing the culture volume in 500-mL shake flasks improved growth and glucose utilization. A maximum biomass concentration of nearly 12 g L−1 was obtained within 4 days at 300 rpm, 30°C, with a glucose utilization of nearly 76% in batch culture. The total fatty acid (TFA) content of the biomass and the TFA productivity were 102 mg g−1 and 305 mg L−1 day−1, respectively. A repeated fed-batch culture with four cycles of feeding with the fivefold concentrated medium in a 3-L bioreactor was evaluated for biomass production. The total culture period was 11 days. A maximum biomass concentration of nearly 26 g L−1 was obtained with a TFA productivity of 223 mg L−1 day−1. The final biomass contained (w/w) 13.5% lipids, 20.8% protein and 17.2% starch. Of the fatty acids produced, 52% (w/w) were saturated, 41% were monounsaturated and 7% were polyunsaturated (PUFA). A low content of PUFA in TFA feedstock is required for producing high quality biodiesel. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

  "abstract": "Alkaline and biological pretreatments were compared for enhancing the biological methane potential of Napier grass. The earlier reported biotreatments for Napier grass did not use the edible white-rot fungus Pleurotus sajor-caju, as in the present work. Dry Napier grass was ground to different particles sizes (20–30 mm, N1-L; ≤0.6 mm, N1-S). The N1-L grass was treated with alkali and designated as the alkali treated grass N2. The samples N1-S, N1-L and N2 were used separately as substrates for growing the fungus for 14 days at room temperature (30 ± 2 °C) in a solid-state biotreatment. Alkali treatment delignified the grass 2.1- to 10.7-fold better than the fungus. Fungal treatment resulted in 3.8- to 8.3-fold loss in glucan compared to alkali treatment. Maximum xylan loss occurred in the N1-S fine-ground grass after fungal growth. The fungus-grown grass samples (N1-FL, N1-FS, N2-F), the untreated ground samples (N1-L, N1-S) and the alkali treated sample (N2) were anaerobically digested to determine the biological methane potential. The fungus-grown grass samples had a maximum daily methane production in the range of 44–50 cm3 g VS−1, significantly higher than the samples not treated with the fungus. The alkali treated grass gave a significantly higher cumulative methane yield than the untreated grass and the biological methane potential was ∼71–77% of the theoretical methane potential. The proportion of methane in the total gas produced from the treated grass was in range of 74–83% by volume whereas it was 57–68% for the untreated grass. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

  "abstract": "Photofermentation of acid hydrolyzed oil palm empty fruit bunch is reported for hydrogen production in repeated-batch fermentations using the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides S10. Photofermentations were carried out at 35 °C at an incident light level of 10 klux. At specified times, different specified volumes of the culture broth were removed and replaced with an equal volume of the fresh medium. The initial mixed carbon (glucose, xylose, acetic acid) content in the medium of the repeated-batch reactors was adjusted to 20 mM. The kinetics of hydrogen production were evaluated in repeated-batch fermentations carried out in various ways: different volume exchange levels, different switch times from batch to repeated-batch operation, and different cycle times. A 90% replacement of the broth volume with the fresh medium proved to be the best, resulting in a maximum hydrogen production rate of 27.7 ± 1.7 mL H 2/L h with a conversion efficiency of 33.7 ± 0.9%. At a fixed broth exchange volume of 90%, experiments with varying intervals between volume exchanges, showed an exchange interval of 84 h to be the best. At this exchange interval, the maximum hydrogen production rate was 35.9 ± 1.6 mL H 2/L h and the conversion efficiency was 42.6 ± 1.0%. With the broth exchange volume fixed at 90%, the batch to repeated-batch switch time fixed at 84 h, four repeated-batch cycles were monitored, each with a cycle time of 60 h. For the five cycles (including the first batch phase), the average conversion efficiency was 51.8 ± 4.8%; the average substrate specific hydrogen production rate was 13.8 ± 2.4 mL H2/g h; and the average maximum hydrogen production rate was 32.3 ± 1.1 mL H 2/L h. Thus, the kinetics of hydrogen production for the five cycles were highly consistent. Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Hemicellulose was recovered from oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) fiber and used for producing xylooligosaccharides (XOS) prebiotics. EFB fibers were treated sequentially with peracetic acid (PA) and alkaline peroxide (AP). The PA treatment removed ∼50 % lignin. The subsequent AP treatment recovered the hemicellulose. The AP treatment was optimized using Taguchi experiment design with L16 orthogonal array consisting of 5 factors (NaOH concentration, H2O2 concentration, MgSO4 concentration, incubation temperature, treatment time) and 4 levels. Data from 16 experimental runs showed that the main effect of the factors on percentage hemicellulose recovery was in the order: NaOH > MgSO4 > incubation temperature > time > H2O2. The optimal conditions for hemicellulose isolation were: 15 % w/v NaOH in the reaction system (3 g NaOH/g delignified EFB), 1% w/v MgSO4 (0.2 g MgSO4/g delignified EFB), 45 °C incubation temperature and a 3 h reaction time. The PA-AP treatments solubilized nearly 53 % of the original dry mass of EFB. The enriched hemicellulose yield on EFB was 18.4 % by weight. Acid hydrolysis of the released hemicellulose produced xylose (44.1 %), glucose (17.6 %), arabinose (2.2 %), galactose (2.2 %), and mannose (4.4 %). Thermomyces lenuginosus xylanase (294.4 U L−1) was used to produce XOS from hemicellulose at 55 °C in a 12-h reaction. The XOS were assessed as substrates for two probiotic bacteria found in human gastrointestinal tract. The probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum WU-P19 utilized XOS better than Bifidobacterium bifidum TISTR 2129. Coculture of the two bacteria was shown to produce mixed fatty acids. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

  "abstract": "This work reports on production of ethanol with simultaneous fixing of nitrogen (N2) using the anaerobic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis DSM 473. A batch fermentation with an initial glucose concentration of 50 g L−1, an initial pH of ∼5.5, an inoculum size of 10% by volume and a N2 feeding rate of 50 mL min−1 without mechanical agitation was found to provide the highest ethanol productivity (0.401 g L−1 h−1). Ethanol yield on glucose exceeded 97% of the theoretical maximum. The nitrogen content of the microbial biomass was 10.4% w/w at 65 h and all of it was derived by fixation of dinitrogen. Repeated-batch fermentations were investigated for ethanol production using simultaneous nitrogen fixation. A 2-cycle repeated-batch fermentation lasting 71 h gave a maximum ethanol yield on glucose of 0.475 g g−1 and an ethanol productivity of 0.675 g L−1 h−1. The yield (0.415 g g−1) and productivity (0.638 g L−1 h−1) were reduced in a 3-cycle repeated batch operation lasting 94 h. The need to fix nitrogen did not reduce the final achievable ethanol concentration, or the ethanol yield on glucose, relative to fermentations provided with fixed nitrogen, but did reduce the ethanol productivity by ∼82% because less cell mass was produced. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

  "abstract": "Oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) are a lignocellulosic by product generated by palm oil mills. Delignified EFB fiber is a potential source of inexpensive hemicellulose, a substrate that is easily hydrolyzed to sugars for use in diverse biotechnological processes. The conditions for maximized selective removal of lignin from EFB fiber via separate treatments with alkaline peroxide and peracetic acid, were established such that the loss of hemicellulose was kept to a minimum. The amount of a reagent used in delignification, the temperature and the length of treatment, were optimized using a combination of Box-Behnken experimental design and the response surface method. Treatments with peracetic acid always left behind more hemicellulose and removed more lignin compared with the treatments involving alkaline peroxide. Under the best conditions (20cm3 peracetic acid per g EFB, 35°C, reaction time of 9h), hemicellulose, cellulose and acid insoluble lignin constituted (dry weight basis) nearly 36%, 47% and ~16%, respectively, of the treated acetone-washed extractive-free EFB fiber. Approximately 53% of the lignin was removed, but nearly all the hemicellulose was retained. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Production of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) by the potential probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum WU-P19 was investigated with the aim of enhancing production. CLA produced using this bacterium may be used to supplement dietary intake. Cultures were fed linoleic acid for conversion to CLA and the CLA produced was measured. In some cases, chitosan was added to cultures to improve cellular uptake of linoleic acid. Under static conditions at 37 °C, the bacterium grew and produced CLA in the pH range of 5.5–6.5. At pH 6.0, a 36-h incubation period maximized the concentration of the dry biomass (0.82 g/L), the CLA content in the biomass (4.1 mg/g), and linoleic acid in the biomass (1.2 mg/g). In comparison with cultures grown without linoleic acid in the medium, supplementing the medium with linoleic acid at 600 μg/mL slowed the production of CLA, but the CLA content in the dry biomass increased to 12–14 mg/g and the linoleic acid content increased to 8–11 mg/g. Supplementing the culture medium with chitosan and linoleic acid enhanced production of CLA in the dry biomass to 21 mg/g within 36 h. Nearly 50% of the CLA was cis-9, trans-11-CLA, and the remainder was trans-10, cis-12-CLA. Linoleic acid content of the dry biomass was increased to 37 mg/g. Accumulation of CLA in the cells was enhanced by feeding linoleic acid. Supplementing the culture with linoleic acid and chitosan further increased accumulation of CLA. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and the University of Milan.",

In using such hydrolysates for photofermentive production of biohydrogen, the gas yield is highly dependent on the composition of the mixed carbon substrate. Batch photofermentation experiments were used to investigate the effect of the composition of the mixed carbon (glucose G, xylose X, and acetic acid A) on growth and hydrogen production by the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides S10. Anaerobic fermentations were carried out at 35°C under an incident light level of 14.6W/m2. The mixed carbon composition strongly influenced hydrogen and biomass production. Depending on the composition of the mixed substrate: the cumulative hydrogen volume ranged from 0.99 to 2.33L H2/L medium; the conversion efficiency ranged from 21% to 45%; and the biomass yield on substrate ranged from 0.28 to 0.47g DCW/g (G+X+A). Based on the conversion efficiency, the optimal substrate for hydrogen production was a mixture of 5mM glucose, 18mM xylose and 7mM acetic acid. This combination gave a cumulative hydrogen volume of 2.33L H2/L medium. The hydrogen yield was 3.56mol H2/mol mixed substrate and the substrate specific hydrogen production rate was 7.26mL H2/g mixed substrate h. The conversion efficiency and the lag period of hydrogen production were 45% and 13h, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",

  "abstract": "Guava (Psidium guajava) pulp was fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum WU-P19 to a product rich in microbially produced vitamin B12 and conjugated linoleic acid. Different initial sucrose levels were tested in the pulp in different fermentations. The 36-hr fermented material had a pH of 3.3–3.4, a lactic acid content of 7.6–8.2 g/L, and a viable L. plantarum count of 108.51–108.56 cells/ml. The fermented pulp was used to make a novel food product, the guava gummy jelly. The guava gummy jelly formulation that was most accepted by a panel of tasters, comprised of 100 g (fresh weight) of fermented guava pulp, 20 g of sucrose, 11 g of glucose syrup, 6 g of gelatin and 0.5 g of citric acid. A 1-g portion of this tasty product could fully meet the daily requirements of vitamin B12, an essential nutrient that is deficient in many diets. Practical applications: Vitamin B12 deficiency in certain diets can be alleviated through consumption of the fermented food product produced here.

Under this experimental design there were 15 different runs with ten factors-yeast extract, KH2PO4, MgSO4, FeSO4, MnCl2, CuSO4, Na2MoO4, H3BO3, ZnSO4 and pH. Cultures were grown mixotrophically under 16 h light and 8 h dark regime at 30°C for a period of 7 days. During the light regime, the light intensity at the surface of the vessels and agitation speed were set to 67.5 μmol photons m-2s-1 and 150 rpm, respectively. Initial cell concentration was set to an absorbance (A540) of 0.5. For high biomass production (2.2 g/L, run no. 6), the most effective and significant factors were yeast extract, KH2PO4, FeSO4 and ZnSO4 at concentrations 0.3 g/L, 0.3 g/L, 3 mg/L and 0.3 mg/L, respectively. Whereas for high lipid accumulation (19.59 %DCW, run no. 2), these were KH2PO4, pH and yeast extract, at a level of 1.7 g/L, 6.0 and 0.1 g/L, respectively. No significant factors were obtained for higher lipid content. The best treatment for biomass and lipid content was run no. 6, whose medium formula consisted of 0.3 g/L yeast extract, 1.7 g/L KH2PO4, 1.7 g/L MgSO4, 1 mg/L FeSO4, 0.9 mg/L MnCl2, and pH 7.0, together with fixed concentrations of glucose, NaHCO3 and KNO3 at 5 g/L, 0.05 g/L and 0.5 g/L, respectively.",

  "abstract": "5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and the biomass of photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodopseudomonas palustris KG31, have very high potential for development and exploitation as bioherbicide and biofertilizer respectively. In this work, the effects of two precursors and an inhibitor of aminolevulinic dehydratase (ALAD) added to the VFA culture medium on the production of ALA and biomass were investigated. The experimental runs were carried out according to a Box-Behnken design. The precursors were added to the medium at the beginning of cultivation, while the inhibitor was added after 24 h. Statistical analysis indicated that levulinic acid (LA) has a positive effect on ALA production while glycine has a negative effect on biomass production. In order to enhance both ALA and biomass products, the most suitable medium was VFA medium supplemented with 3.0mM glycine and 10mM LA, giving ALA and biomass of 182.91μM and 3.1 gDCW/l within 54 h.",

  "abstract": "The microalgae Chlorella protothecoides UTEX 25, Chlorella sp. TISTR 8991, and Chlorella sp. TISTR 8990 were compared for use in the production of biomass and lipids under photoautotrophic conditions. Chlorella sp. TISTR 8990 was shown to be potentially suitable for lipid production at 30°C in a culture medium that contained only inorganic salts. For Chlorella sp. TISTR 8990 in optimal conditions in a stirred tank photobioreactor, the lipid productivity was 2.3 mg L -1 h -1 and after 14 days the biomass contained more than 30% lipids by dry weight. To attain this, the nitrogen was provided as KNO 3 at an initial concentration of 2.05 g L -1 and chelated ferric iron was added at a concentration of 1.2 × 10 -5 mol L -1 on the ninth day. Under the same conditions in culture tubes (36 mm outer diameter), the biomass productivity was 2.8-fold greater than in the photobioreactor (0.125 m in diameter), but the lipid productivity was only 1.2-fold higher. Thus, the average low-light level in the photobioreactor actually increased the biomass specific lipid production compared to the culture tubes. A light-limited growth model closely agreed with the experimental profiles of biomass production, nitrogen consumption, and lipid production in the photobioreactor. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

  "abstract": "Chlorella sp. TISTR 8990 was cultivated heterotrophically in media with various initial carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (C/N ratio) and at different agitation speeds. The production of the biomass, its total fatty acid content and the composition of the fatty acids were affected by the C/N ratio, but not by agitation speed in the range examined. The biomass production was maximized at a C/N mass ratio of 29:1. At this C/N ratio, the biomass productivity was 0.68gL-1d-1, or nearly 1.6-fold the best attainable productivity in photoautotrophic growth. The biomass yield coefficient on glucose was 0.62gg-1 during exponential growth. The total fatty acids (TFAs) in the freeze-dried biomass were maximum (459mgg-1) at a C/N ratio of 95:1. Lower values of the C/N ratio reduced the fatty acid content of the biomass. The maximum productivity of TFAs (186mgL-1d-1) occurred at C/N ratios of 63:1 and higher. At these conditions, the fatty acids were mostly of the polyunsaturated type. Allowing the alga to remain in the stationary phase for a prolonged period after N-depletion, reduced the level of monounsaturated fatty acids and the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids increased. Biotin supplementation of the culture medium reduced the biomass productivity relative to biotin-free control, but had no effect on the total fatty acid content of the biomass. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",

The lag phase for growth and the maximum specific growth rate under microaerobic-light cultivations were 7.29-12.49h and 0.038-0.094 h-1, respectively, whereas under aerobic-dark cultivations, they were 2.03-14.25h and 0.016-0.022 h-1, respectively. The lag phase for extracellular ALA production and the maximum specific extracellular ALA production rate under microaerobic-light cultivations (15.72-24.74h and 0.222-0.299 h-1, respectively) were better than those obtained under aerobic-dark cultivations (24.57-44.84h and 0.103-0.215 h-1, respectively). The biomass and the extracellular ALA yields of 39.66-56.25 gDCW/l/molC, and 148.47-245.75-M/molC, respectively, under microaerobic-light cultivations were higher than of those obtained under aerobic-dark conditions. An enhancement of extracellular ALA production under aerobic-dark conditions revealed that the ALA yield was markedly increased 8-fold (48.36μM) by the addition of 10mM succinate, 4.5mM glycine, and 15mM levulinic acid (LA).

Among the independent isolates from these enrichments 19 evolved hydrogen with productivities between 4 and 326 ml l-1 d-1. Isolate TN1 was the most efficient producer at a rate of 1.85 mol H2 mol acetate-1 with a light conversion efficiency of 1.07%.

Results revealed that the dosages of added Fe3+ and Mo6+ significantly accelerated nitrate utilization and nitrite accumulation. Enzymatic studies revealed that the membrane-bound nitrate reductase and the periplasmic nitrite reductase had activities of 998 ± 28 and 373 ± 18 nmol (mg protein)-1 min-1, respectively after growing Paracoccus pantotrophus P16 in medium supplemented with 1.5 μM Fe3+. If provided with 1.5 μM Fe3+and 2.4 μM Mo6+, the membrane-bound nitrate reductase activity increased to 6,223 ± 502 nmol (mg protein) -1 min-1 and the periplasmic nitrite reductase was 344 ± 20 nmol (mg protein)-1 min-1. The results indicated that an addition of Fe3+ and Mo6+ led to an overstimulation of nitrate reductase activity as compared with nitrite reductase activity. When glucose was supplied, the minimal ratio of carbon per nitrate (C/N) was 2.31 mg C/mg NO3--N with denitrification yield of 0.45 g NO3--N/g C.

  "abstract": "Oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) was hydrolyzed with dilute sulfuric acid (6% v/v; 8 mL acid per g dry OPEFB) at 120°C for 15-min to release the fermentable sugars. The hydrolysate contained xylose (23.51 g/L), acetic acid (2.44 g/L) and glucose (1.80 g/L) as the major carbon components. This hydrolysate was used as the sole carbon source for photofermentive production of hydrogen using a newly identified photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides S10. A Plackett-Burman experimental design was used to examine the influence of the following on hydrogen production: yeast extract concentration, molybdenum concentration, magnesium concentration, EDTA concentration and iron concentration. These factors influenced hydrogen production in the following decreasing order: yeast extract concentration > molybdenum concentration > magnesium concentration > EDTA concentration > iron concentration. Under the conditions used (35°C, 14.6 W/m2 illumination, initial pH of 7.0), the optimal composition of the culture medium was (per L): mixed carbon in OPEFB hydrolysate 3.87 g, K2HPO4 0.9 g, KH 2PO4 0.6 g, CaCl22H2O 75 mg, l-glutamic acid 795.6 mg, FeSO47H2O 11 mg, Na 2MoO22H2O 1.45 mg, MgSO47H 2O 2.46 g, EDTA 0.02 g, yeast extract 0.3 g). With this medium, the lag period of hydrogen production was 7.65 h, the volumetric production rate was 22.4 mL H2/L medium per hour and the specific hydrogen production rate was 7.0 mL H2/g (xylose + glucose + acetic acid) per hour during a 90 h batch culture of the bacterium.

  "abstract": "An extremely halophilic bacterial strain SM5 producing exopolymers was isolated from Thai traditional fermented fish (Pla-ra). Morphological and biochemical properties and 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the strain was Halobacterium sp. SM5. The exopolymers were identified as a water-soluble acidic polymer. They contained 70.40±0.70% (w/w) protein as a major component and 7.30±0.01% (w/w) sulfate as a minor component, as well as 5.02±0.30% (w/w) total sugar, 3.15±0.10% (w/w) neutral sugar and 2.05±0.10% (w/w) uronic acid. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis showed that the exopolymers consisted of carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino and sugar derivative groups. Molecular weight of the exopolymers was 7.7×10 4 and 2.5×105 Da. Cytotoxicity effect of the exopolymers on the HT29 human cell lines revealed that the exopolymers concentration of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml gave the cell a viability of 93.48 and 98.46%, respectively. At the exopolymers concentration of 1.0, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/ml, the cell viability was 71.65, 74.28 and 57.77%, respectively. The exopolymers showed pseudoplastic property, resistance to shearing, and high viscosity (600 cP). Viscosity was increased with the exopolymers concentration (0.5-4.0% w/v). The exopolymers were stable over a wide pH range (6-8), and their viscosity decreased at temperatures above 60°C.",

  "abstract": "Two continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) each fed with palm oil mill effluent (POME), operated at 37°C and 55°C, respectively, were investigated for their performance under varies organic loading rates (OLRs). The 37°C reactor operated successfully at a maximum OLR of 12.25 g[COD]/L/day and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7 days. The 55°C reactor operated successfully at the higher loading rate of 17.01 g[COD]/L/day and had a HRT of 5 days. The 37°C reactor achieved a 71.10% reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), a biogas production rate of 3.73 L of gas/L[reactor]/day containing 71.04% methane, whereas the 55°C reactor achieved a 70.32% reduction of COD, a biogas production rate of 4.66 L of gas/L[reactor]/day containing 69.53% methane. An OLR of 9.68 g[COD]/L/day, at a HRT of 7 days, was used to study the effects of changing the temperature by 3°C increments. The reactor processes were reasonably stable during the increase from 37°C to 43°C and the decrease from 55°C to 43°C. When the temperature was increased from 37°C to 46°C, the total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentration and biogas production was 2,059 mg as acetic acid/L and 1.49 L of gas/L[reactor]/day at day 56, respectively. When the temperature was reduced from 55°C to 40°C, the TVFA concentration and biogas production was 2,368 mg as acetic acid/L and 2.01 L of gas/L[reactor]/day at day 102, respectively. By first reducing the OLR to 4.20 g[COD]/L/day then slowly increasing the OLR back to 9.68 g[COD]/L/day, both reactors were restored to stable conditions at 49°C and 37°C respectively. The initial 37°C reactor became fully acclimatized at 55°C with an efficiency similar to that when operated at the initial 37°C whereas the 55°C reactor also achieved stability at 37°C but with a lower efficiency. © 2007 by Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso.",

  "abstract": "The study investigated on medium optimization for production of exopolymer by a newly isolated bacterium, Halobacterium sp. SM5, using the mixture design and response surface method. The mixture experiment was designed by setting five parameters at the lowest and highest of concentrations: pseudo components design containing 0.15-0.25 glucose, 0.15-0.25 yeast extract, 0.35-0.45 MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1-0.2 vitamin casamino acid and 0.02-0.06 KCl. The results of the mixture design revealed that the effect of nutrients or elements on the exopolymer produced by the strain SM5 were in the order of MgSO4·7H2O > yeast extract > vitamin casamino acid > KCl > glucose, respectively. The suitable medium recipe for enhancement the exopolymer production was 7.43 g/l glucose, 12.38 g/l yeast extract, 17.33 g/l MgSO4·7H2O, 9.9 g/l vitamin casamino acid and 2.48 g/l KCl. The exopolymer to be produced by the strain SM5 was 2.25 g/l, which was higher than that obtained in the original medium (1.3 times). The yield of exopolymer was 2.13 g/l to be obtained in medium containing 7.43 g/l glucose, 11.37 g/l yeast extract, 22.28 g/l MgSO4· 7H2O, 7.44 g/l vitamin casamino acid and 0.99 g/l KCl which was predicted by response surface methodology. However, under an experiment, the yield of exopolymer was 2.08 ± 0.0020 g/l. © 2007 by Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso.",

These values are 87% higher than the pigment content obtained from aerobic cultivation, although the cell biomass of all strains (1.7 to 2.3 g/l) was 22 to 38% higher under aerobic conditions. Protein content was always between 32 and 43%. The specific growth rates of all isolates in aerobic cultivation (0.04 to 0.06 h-1) were twice those in anaerobic conditions in the light.

From a culture fluid of Staphylococcus aureus strain P83, a new protein component of leukocidin or γ-hemolysin which was designated as LukM was isolated. This component showed the same biological activity as that of LukF component for leukocidin or HγI component of γ-hemolysin in combination with LukS or HγII. However, the LukM component cross-reacted with the anti-LukS antibodies but not with the anti-LukF antibodies. On the basis of chemical analysis of the LukM component and the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the lukM gene of S. aureus P83, we have demonstrated that LukM is an entirely new protein component of leukocidin or γ-hemolysin. The deduced amino acid sequence of LukM from the lukM gene showed 66.7% and 67% indentity to that of LukS and Hγll, respectively. However, the amino acid sequence of LukM and LukF showed only 29% homology. © 1995.",

The HγII(P83) showed about 50% of the hemolytic activity of normal HγII in the presence of LukF. © 1995, Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "A Box-Behnken design with three variables (sucrose concentration, initial pH value and soaking time) and three levels were used for studying the demineralization efficiency in fermented shrimp shells by Pediococcus sp. L1/2. First, the bacterial cells were inoculated into the media with various concentrations of sucrose and initial pH values, and fermentation took place under static conditions at 37 °C for 24 h. Significant differences in the levels of total titratable acid were observed. This was followed by adding shrimp shells and soaking them in the fermentation media for 12, 24 and 36 h. The results showed that when the sucrose concentration was 50 g/L, and the initial pH value was 6.00, soaking for 36 h gave a demineralization efficiency of 68.38%. By solving the equation and also analyzing the response surface contour plots, optimum conditions occurred when the sucrose concentration was 50 g/L, the initial pH value was 7.00 and the soaking time was 36 h with a predicted value of demineralization of 83.03% whereas our experiment gave 83.47%. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  "abstract": "A comparative study was undertaken of anaerobic continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) at mesophilic (37°C) and thermophilic (55°C) temperatures. The reactors were operated at different HRT. The results showed that the longer HRT achieved better process stability as total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) levels and TVFA/alkalinity ratio gradually increased response to the lower HRT. At HRT of less than 6 days, the mesophilic reactor could not be operated while the thermophilic reactor worked satisfactorily. TCOD removal in thermophilic reactor was slightly lower (63.3-75.4%) than that in the mesophilic reactor (64.6-80.0%) when the HRT was tested almost to the point of digester failure. The experimental data were evaluated to determine the kinetic parameter of the process. The results achieved methane yield coefficient of 0.378 and 0.333-1 CH4/gTCODremoved and biomass yield coefficient of 0.263 and 0.284 gVSS/gTCOD for mesophilic and thermophilic reactors, respectively. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  "abstract": "Real-time online coral sensor and climatic data are vital for long term ecological observatory research. It is difficult to maintain a continuous real-time online data stream using various underwater sensors feeding to a server. To solve this difficulty, we integrated an event detection and decision support system (DSS) to help researchers to make decisions about sensor maintenance and to proactively prevent system malfunctions. This paper describes the components of pre-processing data in-situ, using behavior learning from historical data, creating anomaly detection, and verifying sensor data. This online system is flexible, for both health monitoring and decision-making. When data loss or sensor malfunctions occur, then an automatic email will be sent to researchers, to show both sensor health and anomaly reports. Researchers will then make a decision on who will fix the problems, and plan for maintenance on site. The integrated decision support system and event detection uses various tools and techniques, such as Mathematica for analysis and open source software (PHP, MySQL, and Highcharts) for visualization. This is the first practical system that uses heterogeneous sensors integrated with flexible cloud storage, which shows both alerts regarding system health and anomaly reports through social media, and helps researchers in decision-making, in order to reduce maintenance time and costs, and to enable long term use of sensor data in order to expand understanding on climate change. © 2016, Walailak University.

  "abstract": "In this research, eri silk yarn was dyed with polydopamine (PDA) formed in situ by oxidation of a dopamine (DA) solution under alkaline condition at pH 8.5 in the presence of oxygen. Eri silk yarn was immersed in different initial concentrations of DA solution (0.010–5.00 mg mL−1) for 24 h, after which the yarn changed to a black/brown color. This indicated that PDA could adhere on the surface of eri silk yarn via Schiff base reactions and/or Michael-type additions. The surface morphologies of PDA-dyed silk yarn in different initial concentrations of DA solution were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopic analysis. It was found that the surface of eri silk yarn became obviously rough, which indicated that PDA was successfully dyed on the surface of eri silk yarn. In addition, all dyed eri silk yarn exhibited a shade of brownish to black with different CIE L*, a*, and b* values. In addition, the color fastness to light and washing of the PDA-dyed eri silk yarn samples using 1.00–5.00 mg mL−1 DA solutions were found to be at very good rating levels of 6 and 4-5, respectively. Therefore, PDA could act as both a dye for eri silk itself and as a photo-protective agent. © 2020 The Textile Institute.",

Batch equilibrium studies showed that the adsorption of lac dye on cotton pretreated with chitosan could be described by the Langmuir isotherm with an enthalpy change (ΔHo) of -17.43 kJ. The pretreatment of cotton with chitosan provided a significant enhancement of dye uptake onto the cotton and also a decrease in the dye desorbed from the cotton compared with the results in the absence of chitosan or on lac dyeing in the presence of NaCl. In addition, sodium chloride had no effect on the adsorption of lac dye on cotton at pH 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5. It indicated that hydrogen ions (H+) play a more important role than sodium ions (Na+) in the dyeing process. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

  "abstract": "Conformations and spectroscopic properties of laccaic acid A (lacA) were studied by means of the experimental and theoretical approaches. The minimum energy conformers of lacA in the gas phase and in implicit water obtained from the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) calculations displayed the same orientation of the COOH and OH groups on the anthraquinone-based component. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) formed between the COOH, CO and OH groups are very strong. In contrast, the orientations of the Ph(OH)CH2CH2NHCOCH 3 substituent moiety on the anthraquinone-based component in the gas phase and in implicit water are completely different. The substituent prefers to bind with the anthraquinone-based component in the gas phase while it moves away from the anthraquinone-based component in implicit water. The calculated IR spectra of the two lowest-lying energy conformers of lacA in the gas phase fit to the experimental FTIR spectrum. The full assignments of the vibrational modes with the correlated vibrational wavenumbers of those conformers were proposed here, for the first time. The intramolecular H-bond formations in lacA can cause the shift of the vibrational wavenumber for the COOH, CO, OH and NH groups as compared to the normal vibrations of these groups. The NMR spectra showed that the stabilities of the two lowest-lying energy conformers of lacA in the gas phase are comparable and this is consistent with their computational energies. The UV-Vis spectra of the lowest-lying energy conformers of lacA in implicit water were compared with the experimental UV-Vis spectrum. The calculations suggested that the electronic transition in the visible region involves with the singlet π → π- excitation which the electron density transfers to a COOH group on the anthraquinone ring. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  "abstract": "Polydopamine (PDA) is a kind of mussel-inspired material. It has been applied as a coating and an adsorbent material. As an adsorbent, the PDA microspheres were used to remove methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution. It was reported that the efficiency of the PDA adsorbent depends on the pH of the solution. Furthermore, in a pH range of 3-10, the hydroxyl and amine functional groups of PDA can be either protonated or deprotonated. The change of the net charge of PDA can affect the intermolecular interactions between PDA and MB. It was proposed that both of the electrostatic and π-π interactions should be dominant in the acidic and basic solutions. Therefore, the structural properties and intermolecular interactions of the PDA-MB complex should be investigated. Such an investigation can be useful for the improvement of the PDA microspheres for the other dyes. To get insight into the roles of PDA structure and its role as an interesting adsorbent for MB, the PDA-MB complex formation was carried out at pH 7. The PDA dimers which have six possible structures were selected. The optimization of all PDA dimers and MB was performed in the gas phase at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) calculations. After that, the complex formation of the optimized PDA dimers and MB was performed using the AutoDock Vina V1.1.2. The binding free energy of the PDA dimers and MB was in a range of-3.2 to-3.7 kcal/mol, which indicated that the binding of PDA dimer and MB is spontaneous. The results showed that the π-π interaction between PDA dimer and MB plays a crucial role in the complex formation. Likewise, the sandwich-like structures of the complexes are more stable than the twisted structures. © 2020, Walailak University. All rights reserved.",

These treated cotton yarns are then dyed with the annatto dye extract from Bixa orellana L. (Achiote) seeds and tested for different properties including K/S value, light fastness, and wash fastness. Pre-treatment of cotton yarn with chitosan or microcrystalline chitosan solution (together with glyoxal cross-linking) or quaternized chitosan, or Sera® Fast C-NC before dyeing, shows a better color depth (K/S) and improved wash fastness properties in comparison to yarn with alum post-mordanting and the untreated cotton yarn. Improved light fastness is also obtained on inclusion of the anti-oxidant ascorbic acid in the post-treatment protocol.

  "abstract": "Flavonoid constituents from the aqueous extract of the leaves of Eupatorium odoratum, an invasive weed in Thailand, have potential use as dyestuffs for cotton dyeing. It was found that cotton yarn, which was pretreated with a chitosan solution (with and without a crosslinking glyoxal solution), followed by dyeing with E. odoratum extract in the presence of the inorganic mordant, alum, provided better depth of shade (K/S) and also gave better fastness to light and washing than the untreated cotton yarn. Pretreated cotton yarn with the biomordant solution from Memecylon scutellatum leaves gave relatively poor light and wash fastness of the resultant dyed cotton in the presence of alum. From the toxicity studies, the aqueous extract of the leaves of E. odoratum before and after dyeing showed a high toxicity level to the earthworm (Diplocardia communis) and the guppy fish (Poecilia reticulate). Therefore, it is strongly suggested that E. odoratum aqueous extract after dyeing should be significantly diluted before discharged into the environment. © 2011 The Authors.

  "abstract": "The extracted dye from the dried fruit hulls of mangosteen was used as a natural dye for the dyeing of cotton and silk yarn. The optimal conditions for dye extraction were to extract the dried fruit hulls of mangosteen at 80°C for 1 hour with a 15 % w/v citric acid solution in a 1:4 ratio of mangosteen powder to solvent. Cotton dyeing with the extracted dye from the dried fruit hulls of mangosteen was carried out at 60°C for 60 minutes with a material to liquor ratio of 1:25. The effect on dyeing of mordant type with different mordanting methods was studied. The results showed that the dyeing of cotton using the post-mordanting method with ferrous sulfate and calcium hydroxide not only provided better depth of shade but also provided better wash fastness and light fastness than with other mordants (alum; zinc tetrafluoroborate) or without a mordant. Good fastness properties were also obtained using a post-mordanted silk with calcium hydroxide.",

  "abstract": "One of the problems occasionally associated with the use of natural dyes in the dyeing of silk is the susceptibility of the dyed yarn to fading in light. While a number of approaches have been used to address this problem, the use of polydopamine (PDA), a known agent with photo-protective properties, has not been assessed previously. In this study, silk was pretreated with nano-particulate PDA formed in situ by oxidation of a dopamine solution, then dyed with lac dye or annatto dye as model natural dyes. Photofading rates were significantly reduced in the case of annatto-dyed, PDA-coated silk relative to uncoated silk, while wash fastness was unaffected and remained only moderately good. In contrast, no significant change was seen in photofading rates with treated or untreated lac-dyed silk, and wash fastness was also unaffected. The PDA did not adversely affect resultant colour values if the concentration of the dopamine precursor was kept low. When this was done, acceptable colours were obtained in the dyed silk. Further investigation is warranted of PDA as a photofading protectant and mordant with other natural dyes on silk and other fibres. © 2019 The Authors.

  "abstract": "The thermodynamics of adsorption of laccaic acid (lac dye) onto chitosan were investigated under acidic condition over various concentrations (20-293 mg/l). Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherms were used to analyze the equilibrium data at different temperatures, with the Freundlich isotherm fitting the experimental data significantly better than the other isotherms. The effect of temperature on the adsorption isotherm was studied by carrying out a series of isotherms at 10, 20, 40, and 60 °C. It was found that more dye was strongly adsorbed by chitosan when the temperature of the dye solution increased. Thermodynamic parameters such as free energy change (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°), and entropy change (ΔS°) were also evaluated. The negative value of ΔG° and positive value of ΔH° indicated that the laccaic acid adsorption process is a spontaneous and an endothermic one. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the functional groups of chitosan that affected the laccaic acid adsorption. Therefore, laccaic acid molecules could interact with the chitosan via electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and ion-dipole interactions under acidic condition. From the toxicity study, the dye solution with the initial dye concentrations of 40 and 120 mg/l before dye removal showed significant mortality to earthworm Diplocardia communis (P[removed]",

  "abstract": "Polydopamine/Ag (PDA/Ag) nanoparticles were synthesized for methylene blue (MB) removal from aqueous solution as a model dye. These particles were prepared in a modified literature procedure in which polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles were first prepared via the oxidative polymerization of dopamine (DA) under alkaline conditions in the presence of oxygen. Subsequently, nanoparticulate PDA/Ag was accessed from direct reduction of silver precursor [Ag(NH3)2]+ ions by catechol amino groups in the PDA structure to form Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) fixed on the PDA surface. Confirmation of the formation of the PDA and PDA/Ag nanoparticles, plus characterization of their surface morphologies was achieved. In the MB adsorption studies, the various factors affecting the dye adsorption and thermodynamic parameters were investigated in detail. This adsorption process can be described well by the Langmuir model. In order to gain a deeper molecular insight into this process, we investigated some possible local model structures of PDA/Ag nanoparticles and MB interaction with these structures using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicated that the adsorption energies (E ads) of MB on the PDA/Ag nanoparticles were higher than the E ads of MB on PDA nanoparticles, which was consistent with the experimental results. Our results provide a significant new finding for the role of Ag nanoparticles in the MB adsorption process on PDA/Ag nanoparticles. Readily accessible nanoparticulate PDA/Ag was shown to be a highly effective adsorbent for MB from aqueous solution and thus has significant potential for applications in wastewater dye removal. © 2022 The Textile Institute.",

  "abstract": "As part of an investigation on mordants and lac dyeing of silk and cotton, UV-VIS spectroscopic studies were carried out on the effect of pH and metal ions on Thai lac dye extracted from stick lac from the Rain tree in northeast Thailand. These results were compared with those from commercial lac dye (Wako Company), and from laccaic acids A and B. It was shown that increasing the metal ion concentration caused a bathochromic shift of the lac dye absorption bands in the visible region in both the laccaic acids A and B and the dyes. Also when the pH of the lac dye solution was increased from 2.5 to 11, a substantial bathochromic shift of the lac dye visible absorption band was observed in both Wako and Thai lac dyes. At alkaline pH, the phenolic hydroxyl (and carboxylic acid groups) in lac dye molecules is deprotonated, resulting in a pronounced bathochromic shift. The study also indicated that when the concentration of metal salts increased within the range of concentrations studied, the intensity of the long wavelength absorption band of laccaic acid A, laccaic acid B and commercial lac dye increased accordingly. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  "abstract": "The hypothesis that the dried, ground biomass of the red marine alga Gracilaria tenuistipitata could be used for the efficient removal of lac dye from aqueous solution was assessed in this work. The effects of parameters such as initial pH, biosorbent dosage, contact time, initial dye concentration, and temperature on the biosorption capacity of the dye were investigated. Equilibrium data were analysed using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models, and the Freundlich model provided the highest coefficient of determination values. Biosorption kinetic data were successfully described with a pseudo-second-order model at initial dye concentrations of 50, 80, 100, and 120 mg l−1. The thermodynamic parameters of biosorption – enthalpy change (∆H° = −30.64 kJ mol−1), free energy change (∆G° = 4.32 kJ mol−1 at 303 K to 7.78 kJ mol−1 at 333 K), and entropy change (∆S° = −115.38 J mol−1 K−1) – were determined. The negative value of the enthalpy change and positive values of the free energy change indicate that the biosorption process is exothermic and non-spontaneous. The negative value of the entropy change is consistent with decreased randomness at the solid–liquid interface with dye biosorption. Attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of lac dye on the G. tenuistipitata material. The efficiency of lac dye removal by this biomass material at 20 g l−1 and with an initial dye concentration of 50 mg l−1 in acidic solution was 71%, which indicated its potential usefulness as a new dye biosorbent. © 2016 The Authors.

In the current work, the dyeing of eri silk yarn with lac dye was investigated, with both components being accessed in Thailand. While some qualitative studies of this particular dye-yarn combination have been reported, more quantitative aspects, which could give a deeper molecular understanding of the process, have not been described. The aim of the current research was thus to obtain quantitative details on the kinetics of lac dye adsorption on eri silk yarn which then might also underpin better village-based dyeing procedures. The adsorption kinetics of lac dye on village-produced yarn revealed an increase in the adsorption rate constant and diffusion coefficient with an increase in temperature owing to a diffusion kinetically controlled process. At higher temperatures, a lower affinity and less dye uptake was observed after the equilibrium state had been reached, consistent with an exothermic adsorption process. The effect of a mordant on the dyed eri silk yarn was also assessed. Different shades of colour could be obtained on the silk yarn by changing the mordant used. In addition, post-mordanting with different mordants significantly improved wash and light fastness properties. © 2021 The Textile Institute.",

  "abstract": "The coating of silk yarn with microcrystalline chitosan (MCCh) was carried out using the ultrasonic-assisted method at a pulsed wave frequency of 80 kHz, which only had a slight impact on the yarn as measured by changes in Young's modulus and percentage of elongation compared with untreated silk. A significant enhancement of lac dye uptake onto MCCh-coated silk yarn compared with the untreated silk was observed. The rate of dye uptake at different temperatures onto silk yarn coated with MCCh was investigated. It was found that the adsorption rate constant and diffusion coefficient both increased with increasing temperature, as a result of a diffusion kinetically controlled process with a diffusion activation energy of 9.40 kJ mol−1. This suggests that dye adsorption on silk yarn coated with MCCh is a physisorption process. The free energy change (∆G○), enthalpy change (∆H○) and entropy change for dye adsorption were also determined, and the negative values of ∆G○ and ∆H○ obtained indicated that the lac dye adsorption process is both spontaneous and exothermic. © 2019 The Authors.

  "abstract": "In this study, silk yarn was treated with polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) formed in situ by oxidation of a dopamine solution in the presence of oxygen. The adsorption kinetics of lac dye on the PDA-coated silk yarn at different temperatures was investigated. The values of the dye adsorption rate constant (k) at different temperature were calculated using the modified Cegarra-Puente equation. The results showed that the dye adsorption rate constant (k) and the diffusion coefficient (D) increased with an increasing temperature, which was consistent with a kinetically controlled diffusion process. The activation energy (Ea) was found to be 51.2 kJ mol–1. The adsorption isotherm of lac dye on the PDA-coated silk yarn at pH 2.50 was studied in a batch system. The findings revealed that the adsorption isotherm could be described by the Langmuir isotherm (R2 > 0.99). The results indicated that the pretreatment of silk yarn with PDA, followed by dyeing with an aqueous solution of lac dye and then post-mordanting with alum, exhibited color fastness to light and washing at rating levels of 4 and 3-4, respectively. © 2020 Editura Academiei Romane.

  "abstract": "Adsorption and kinetic studies of lac dyeing of silk were investigated using, as optimal conditions, a pH of 3.0, a material to liquor ratio (MLR) of 1:100, an initial dye concentration of 450 mg/L and 60 min contact time. The progress of dye adsorption was monitored at λmax 487 nm by visible spectroscopy. The experimental data fitted well to the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms with a high correlation coefficient (R2). The pseudo second-order kinetic model was indicated with the activation energy of 47.5 kJ/mol. It is suggested that the overall rate of lac dye adsorption is likely to be controlled by the chemical process. The values of the enthalpy (ΔH#) and entropy of activation (ΔS#) were 44.7 kJ/mol and -175.7 J/mol K, respectively. The free energy of activation (ΔG#) at 30 °C was 97.9 kJ/mol. The activation parameters with and without erythrolaccin in the lac dye were similar, consistent with erythrolaccin only having a slight effect on the lac dyeing of silk. The free energy (ΔG°), enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy (ΔS°) terms for the lac dyeing were also determined, and the negative values of ΔG° and ΔH° obtained indicated that the lac dye adsorption process is a spontaneous and an exothermic one. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
